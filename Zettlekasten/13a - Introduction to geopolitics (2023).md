## Geopolitical interactions and globalisation
## Geopolitical actors and interactions
**Geopolitics** is the study of the **interactions among nations and their citizens and organisation** at the highest level. **State actors** (**national governments**) determine relations between countries which can be cooperative or competitive in nature.

A **cooperative country** is one who engages and **reciprocates**:
- Rules and standardisation
- Harmonisation of tariffs
- Free movement of goods, services, people and capital across borders
- Transfer of technology

In contrast, a **non-cooperative country** often **retaliates** with:
- Inconsistent rules
- Arbitrary tariffs
- Restricted movement across borders
- Limited technology exchange

#### Degrees of cooperation and reasons for certain interest
**Degree of cooperation** between nations:
- can **vary** across different areas and can **change over time**
- countries may be more cooperative on certain issues and less cooperative on others
- **cooperation** is influenced by the **interests and actors** within a country

**State actors**:
- prioritise their interests and choose to cooperate where their interests align
- conflicts in areas of higher priority may lead to dropping cooperation in areas of lower priority.
- the priorities of a nation can change with each political cycle as decision-makers change
- political cycles with short terms **may prioritise short-term goals** like economic growth over long-term goals (e.g. climate change or income inequality may receive less attention in short-term-focused political cycles)

#### National security
**National security**:
- is a top priority for most nations
- includes **military deterrence** and **securing access to resources like energy, food, or water**.
- geographic factors can influence cooperation priorities, such as landlocked countries relying on neighbours for vital resource access (e.g. Switzerland).
- Nations prioritise cooperation in areas related to national security to ensure their interests are protected

#### Geophysical resource endowment
The country's **geophysical resource endowment** may **influence its interactions with other nations**.

  
**Geophysical resource endowment** refers to:
- the natural resources and reserves found within a country's geographical boundaries
- it can impact its interactions with other nations
- **Resource-rich** countries have a higher level of self-sufficiency in their resources (e.g.  U.S., Russia, Australia, and China)
- **Resource-poor** countries heavily rely on other nations for key factors of production, especially energy (e.g. Japan and many European countries)
- resource endowment disparities can affect the terms of engagement between countries.
- resource-rich nations often have more political leverage over resource-dependent countries.

#### Non-state actors
**Non-state actors** refer to **corporations**, **non-government organisations (NGOs)** and **powerful individuals** of a country.

**Non-state actors**:
- often have strong incentives to cooperate across borders due to their resource allocation and value maximisation objectives.
- **State and non-state actors may collaborate** to establish standardised regulations and processes to facilitate the flow of resources.
- An example of such collaboration is the **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**, which harmonises accounting practices across countries, fostering trust in cross-border investments.

#### Cultural factors
**Cultural factors**:
- refers to various aspects of a society's culture that can influence individuals, groups, and institutions within that society (e.g. shared values, beliefs, norms, customs, traditions, language, and other cultural practices that shape the behaviour and interactions of people)
- can influence a country's **level of cooperation**
- play a role in facilitating or hindering cooperation
- strong and stable institutions can make cooperation easier for both state and non-state actors.
- cultural exchange is a means through which a country can **exercise soft power (ability to shape preferences, values, and behaviour through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion)** and influence other countries without resorting to force.

## Globalisation
**Globalisation** is the process of worldwide integration, involving interactions among people, organisations, and companies:
- it encompasses the trade of goods, information, jobs, and culture across borders, as well as the easy flow of capital and market-based currency exchange.
- experienced significant growth **until the 2008 global financial crisis**, after which trade between countries began to slow.
- The **COVID-19 pandemic** further hindered globalisation due to supply chain disruptions and closed borders, leading to an increase in **nationalism**.

**Nationalism** refers to a country's pursuit of its own economic interests, sometimes at the expense of other nations' interests:
- can be seen as **anti-globalisation**, resulting in limited trade, restricted capital flows, and restricted currency exchange.

#### Benefits of globalisation
**Benefits of globalisation** include:
- access to resources and markets
- â†‘ sales and â†“ costs
- â†‘ choice to consumers, higher quality goods
- â†‘ competition among firms, â†‘ efficiency and labour mobility
- intrinsic gains like personal growth or education that individuals may receive from exchange of knowledge, information and culture

#### Downside of globalisation
**Downside of globalisation** include:
- **Some workers may lose out** - e.g. lost of competitiveness of local workers
- **Exploitation of lower ESG standards** - e.g. European company may decide to shift production to a country with cheaper cost and ESG requirements
- **Income inequality between business owners and workers**
- **Protectionist policies**
- **Interdependent supply chain**
- **Supply chain disruption**

### Quadrants of globalisation, nationalism, corporation and conflict
As with **cooperation** and **non-cooperation**, the actions of **globalisation** and **nationalism** can be viewed as a spectrum. This creates four quadrants that describe the behaviour of a country. This gives us a general framework to describe geopolitical actions.

The 4 quadrants are as follows:
- **Autarky**
- **Hegemony**
- **Multilateralism**
- **Bilateralism**

#### Autarky
**Autarky** describes countries that:
- Seek **self-sufficiency** with little or no external trade or finance
- **State-owned enterprises** control strategic domestic industries
- **Complete control** over the supply of technology, goods and services, media and political messaging

e.g. **the early part of the 20th century, China** could have been described as autocratic, exercising very little political cooperation or globalisation. However, China's autocratic stance resulted in substantial poverty and an eventual move towards more economic and financial cooperation.

#### Hegemony
**Hegemony** refers to countries that are:
- **open to globalisation** but influence other countries without necessarily cooperating
- **state-owned** enterprises tend to control key export markets

e.g. **China can be seen as moving from autarky to hegemony from late 20th century to the early part of the 21st century**.

As its economy grew rapidly, its political and economic influence increased. One area where China exerted its influence is in technology transfer, where some companies that wish to operate in the country were made to transfer their technology and processes to Chinese partners.

#### Multilateralism
Multilateralism describes countries that:
- establish **mutually beneficial trade relationships** and extensive rules of harmonisation with **several countries** or **trading blocs**.

e.g. Singapore - The small country has very limited natural resources, so it is highly dependent on trading partners for factors of production. Its geographic position along major trade routes, political stability, low taxes and willingness to cooperate has made it an attractive trading partner and investments destination. However, being so open and connected also means the countries more vulnerable to certain geopolitical risks.

#### Bilateralism
**Bilateralism** refers to countries:
- **Willing to cooperate, but only on a 1-to-1** basis with selected countries

As the world has shifted towards globalisation, few countries fit the bilateral definition today.
Typically, countries exist on a spectrum between bilateralism and multilateralism, which is regionalism in which a group of countries cooperate with one another.

## Types of geopolitical tools
The **tools of geopolitics** are the means by which **state actors advance their interests in the world**. The other aspect to consider is if the tool advances **globalisation** or **nationalism**. It can again be seen as a quadrant of with **cooperation** and **non-cooperation**, the actions of **globalisation** and **nationalism** can be viewed as a spectrum. This creates 

The geopolitical may be classified as:
- **National security tools** - include armed conflict, espionage, terrorism
- **Economic tools**
- **Financial tools**

### National security tools
#### Conflict and nationalism's national security tools
For countries with agenda of nationalism and conflict, there are 3 major national security tools: 
- **Armed conflict** - at the expense of high economic costs; Neighbouring countries that accept war refugees can incur significant short term costs in housing and feeding the refugees, in the long term, refugees that settle down can improve the labour and capital stock of the country
- **Espionage**
- **Terrorism**
The threat of military action creates conflicts between nations. 

#### Cooperation and nationalism's national security tools
**Military alliances** like the NATO's advance cooperation between the member nations, but they may form a division between members and non-members, such alliances are a deviation from globalisation.

### Economic tools
#### Cooperate and globalisation economic tools
For cooperative and globalisation countries, **economic tools** can include:
- **Multilateral trade agreements** - e.g. WTO for the harmonisation of global trade rules.
- **Common market** - e.g. EU

#### Conflict and nationalism economic tools
For nationalisation and conflict countries, **economic tools** can include:
- **Nationalisation of key export firms** - sectors vital to economic, security or competitiveness.
- **Tariffs, quotas** - inhibit global trade
- **Voluntary export restraints** - inhibit global trade
- **Impose domestic content requirements** - asserting that a specific domestic input be included in an exported good.

### Financial tools
Financial tools are the actions used to reinforce **cooperative** or **non-cooperative stance**s via financial mechanisms.

#### Cooperative and globalisation financial tools
**Cooperative financial tools** include:
- Free exchange of currencies across borders
- Allow foreign investment

#### Conflict and nationalism financial tools
**Conflict and nationalism** financial tools include:
- Restriction of exchange of currencies across borders 
- Restrictions in foreign investment
- Non-cooperative sanctions

## Analysis of geopolitical risk
There are several different types of geopolitical risks:
- **Event risk** - timing but not outcome
- **Exogenous risk** - unanticipated events
- **Thematic risk** - effects over longer period of time

### Event risk
**Event risk** refers to events which we **know the timing** **but not the outcomes**. e.g. we know the date of an upcoming national election, but not the outcome.

### Exogenous risk
**Exogenous risk** refers to unanticipated events such as the outbreaks of war or the aftermath
of natural disasters. Natural disasters may not be geopolitical events, but the response to such events could pose geopolitical risks. Geopolitical risk can affect investment values.

e.g. the 2011 tsunami at Fukushima nuclear plant caused several countries to abandon or scale back on their nuclear energy programs.

### Thematic risk
**Thematic risks** refer to known factors that have effects over long periods, such as climate change and cyber threats.

By increasing or decreasing the risk premium investors require to hold assets in a country or region as an investor or portfolio manager.

### Geopolitical risk analysis
**Assess the effect of a geopolitical risk**:
- **Likelihood** - Probability of occurrence?
- **Velocity** - How quickly investments get impacted?
- **Impact** - Size and nature?

We can use our framework of **cooperation and globalisation** to help estimate the likelihood of geopolitical risk.

#### Likelihood of geopolitical risks
#### Cooperate and globalisation countries geopolitical risk
Countries that are **more cooperative and globalised** tend to:
- have less likelihood of some geopolitical risks, e.g. armed conflict
- may have greater likelihood of other risks, such as the supply chain disruption

#### Conflict and nationalism countries geopolitical risk
Countries that are **with more conflict and nationalism** tend to:
- have political instability
- economic need
- motivations of politicians

To help identify geopolitical risks over time, investors may identify signposts or data that can signal when the likelihood of an event is increasing or decreasing, such as volatility indicators in financial markets.

The possibilities are endless, so investors should consider the likelihood in conjunction with the velocity and impact of the geopolitical risk.

### Velocity of geopolitical risks
**Velocity or the pace** at which the geopolitical risk affects the investment portfolio.

We can classify geopolitical risks as:
- **High velocity** - which play out in the short term 
	- e.g. **Exogenous** risks, such as an unexpected protest event
	- **Black swan** risk is a term for the risk of **low likelihood exogenous events** that have substantial short term effects.
	- Investors with longer time horizons typically do not need to react to these kinds of events, but investors with shorter horizons might find it necessary to react.
- **Medium velocity** - the effect spreads over the long term
- **Low velocity** - the effect spreads over the long term

### Impact of geopolitical risks
Geopolitical risks may have:
- Low impact
- High impact - As the entire analytical process requires significant effort, time and resources, investors should only focus their analysis on risks that could have a high impact.

Investors often use **qualitative** or **quantitative** scenario analysis to gauge the potential effects of geopolitical risks on their portfolios.

Also, investors should determine whether they are likely to have **discrete impacts** on a company or **industry** or **broad impacts** on a country or region or the world.

The size of the impact may also be analysed with reference to the **stage of the business cycle**. Geopolitical risks may have greater impacts on investment values when an economy is in recession than they would have during an expansion.

## Course of action in facing geopolitical risk
Importance of geopolitical risk to the investment process depends on:
- Investors objective
- Risk tolerance
- Time horizon

e.g. investor with low risk tolerance, reducing exposure to geopolitical risk may be appropriate, whether through low volatility, investment choices or through hedging.

e.g2. investor with a long time horizon, a high velocity geopolitical event like an exogenous shock, could be a buying opportunity for an investor nearing retirement.

That is, he has a shorter time horizon that same exogenous shock can have a major negative impact on their terminal portfolio value.

Such investors may want to overweight on safe haven assets in the face of heightened geopolitical threats.
