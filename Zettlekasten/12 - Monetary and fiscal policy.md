## Money and its creation process
### Money and its functions
**Money** is simply a **medium of exchange**, rather than exchanging goods and services directly in a bartering system, using **money facilitates indirect exchange**.

There are 3 major functions of money:
- **Means of payment** - facilitating transactions as a widely accepted form of payment
- **Universal unit of account** - less ambiguity in value
- **Store of value** -held and stored for future use

### Money creation process
**Fractional reserve banking** is when **the bank** holds a **minimum % of (cash) deposits** known as the **reserve requirement**, so it is **legally allowed to lend out the excess to earn interest**. This can theoretically **continue from depositing into the bank to another bank until there's no more money left to be deposited and loaned out**.

The equation of **money created** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Money\,created=\frac{New\,deposit}{Reserve\,requirement}}$$

The **equation of money multiplier** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Money\,multiplier=\frac{1}{Reserve\,requirement}}$$

The equation states that the mathematical relationship of â†“ reserve requirement will â†‘ money created.

### Central bank's definition
There are two major types of differences in money definition between **Federal Reserves** and **European central bank**. Federal reserves divided into M1 and M2 circulation; whereas European central bank divide into M1, M2, and M3.

According to the **federal reserves**, the **narrow money (M1)** include:
- **Notes and coins in circulation**
- Very liquid assets (e.g. bank deposits in current accounts, traveler's cheques of nonbank issuers, demand deposits at commercial banks, plus other deposits on which cheques can be written)

According to the **federal reserves**, the **broad money (M2)** include:
- **Narrow money**
- **Some less liquid assets**, which can still be used to make purchases (e.g. savings and money market deposits, time deposit accounts of less than 100000 dollars, plus other balances in retail, money market and mutual funds)

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 14.54.07.png]]

According to the **European central bank**, the **narrow money (M1)** include:
- **Notes and coins in circulation**
- All overnight deposits

According to the **European central bank**, the **broad money (M2)** include:
- **Narrow money**
- Deposits redeemable with notice up to 3 months, deposits with maturity up to 2 years.

According to the **European central bank**, the **broadest money (M3)** include:
- **Narrow money + broad money**
- Repurchase agreements, money market fund units, debt securities up to 2 years maturity.

## Demand and supply of money
### Demand for money
**Demand for money** is the amount of wealth that households and firms in an economy choose to hold in the form of money, and consists of not just the notes and coins in circulation, but also the balances of very liquid bank deposits.

There are 3 main reasons for holding money:
- **Transaction demand** - â†‘GDP, â†‘ transaction demand
- **Precautionary demand** - held for unforeseen future needs; â†‘GDP, â†‘ precautionary demand
- **Speculative demand** - set aside to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future

#### Factors that affect speculative demands
There are 3 main factors that affect speculative demands:
- **Expected returns** - â†‘ Expected returns, â†“ Speculative demands (i.e. set aside to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future)
- **Perceived market risk** - â†‘ Perceived market risk, â†‘ Speculative demands
- **Short-term interest rates** - i.e. interest rate of risk-free bonds - â†‘ Interest rates, â†“ Speculative demands

### Relationship with interest rate
The **money demand curve against nominal interest rate**, it should be **downward sloping** as it has an **inverse relationship** between speculative demands and interest rate. The supply of money is determined by the **central bank**, so it is a **perfectly inelastic supply curve** and it is independent of the interest rate.

**Short term interest rates** are determined by the **equilibrium** between **money supply** and **money demand**.

If the interest rate is above the equilibrium rate, there is excess supply of real money. Firms and households are holding more real money balances than they desire, so they'll purchase short term bonds to reduce their money balances, which will decrease the interest rate as bond prices are bid up and vice versa

**Central bank** can affect short term interest rates by increasing or decreasing the money supply, e.g. an increase in the money supply will shift the money supply curve to the right.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.03.14.png]]

### Relationship with price level 
**Money neutrality** is the belief where increase in the **money supply** will result in an **increase in the aggregate price level**, while real output and money velocity remains unchanged.

The **quantity theory of money (QTM)** states that the **quantity of money is proportional to total spending**. This theory is explained in terms of this equation known as the **quantity equation of exchange**, which is as follows:
$$\mathrm{M\times V=P\times Y}$$
where $M$: the quantity of money or money supply; $V$: velocity of circulation of money, which is the average number of times each unit of money is used for purchases; $P$: average price level; $Y$: real output.

**Monetarists** believe that the **velocity** and the **real output** of the economy change **very slowly**.  **Assuming that velocity and real output remain constant**, any **increase in the money supply** will lead to a **proportionate increase in the price level**. Monetarists argue that **monetary policy** to regulate the supply of money can be used to **control inflation** in an economy.

The **quantity equation of exchange is MV = PY**. If velocity (V) is increasing faster than real output (Y), inflation (P) would have to be increasing faster than the money supply (M) to keep the equation in balance.

The **quantity theory** focuses on the quantity of money. The quantity theory states that velocity is not affected by monetary policy. Increasing banks' excess reserves would most likely lead to higher inflation.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.09.02.png]]

## Expected and unexpected inflation
### Fisher effect 
The **Fisher effect** states that the **real interest rate (IR) in an economy is stable over time**, so that changes in **nominal interest rates are the result of changes in expected inflation**. This is consistent with **money neutrality,** that an increase in money supply will result in an increase in price levels when all else remains equal. Over the long term, the **growth in money supply** should not affect real interest rate, but will **affect inflation and inflation expectations**.

The equation of **nominal interest rate** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Nominal\,IR=Real\,IR+Expected\,inflation}$$

Since the investors are uncertain about future inflation and real growth to compensate them for this uncertainty and investors require a risk premium. Therefore, the updated equation of **nominal interest rate** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Nominal\,IR=Real\,IR+Expected\,inflation+Risk\,premium}$$
where the nominal IR is comprised of 3 major components: real IR is required real return, expected inflation to compensate the expected inflation, and risk premium to compensate for uncertainty.


![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.14.08.png]]

### Cost of inflation
**Central banks** want to **maintain inflation in a narrow band** such that **inflation expectations are met**. **Expected inflation** is the level of inflation that the government households and businesses expect in the future. **Unexpected inflation** is the level of inflation experienced that is above or below the expected inflation.

**Cost of inflation** regardless of whether it is expected or not, include:
- **Menu cost** - businesses constantly have to change the advertised prices of their goods and services
- **Shoe leather costs** - costs to individuals of making frequent trips to the bank to minimise their holdings of cash, which are depreciating in value due to inflation.
- **Implicit cost** of holding money rather than interest bearing securities is higher - Â tend to shift more of their money from the bank to interest bearing securities like government bonds, the cost of such transactions can be significant.

#### Expected inflation
Other than these costs, actually high inflation may not be that costly if it were perfectly anticipated. When inflation **falls according to expectations**, expectation would become the **self-fulfilling prophecy**.

#### Unexpected inflation and consequences
There are certain consequences for unexpected inflation:
- inequitable transfers of wealth between borrowers and lenders 
- higher risk premium in borrowing rates
- lower information content of market price
- exacerbate economic cycle 

Arguably, it's unexpected inflation that is more costly. When inflation turns out to be higher than anticipated, then **borrowers benefit at the expense of lenders** because the **real value of their borrowing declines** as the **interest does not even fully compensate for the diminished purchasing power**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.26.54.png]]

**If inflation is very uncertain or very volatile**, then lenders will ask for a **higher risk premium to compensate them for this uncertainty** (i.e. high risk premium). As a result, the costs of borrowing will be higher to businesses.

It is also possible that inflation uncertainty can exacerbate the economic cycle.
e.g. suppose that one expected inflation is 2.5 percent, a manufacturer sees that prices for his products have increased 6%. If this is interpreted as an increase in demand for the product, the manufacturer will increase capacity and production in response to the perceived increase in demand. If, in fact, general price inflation is six percent rather than the expected 2.5% over the recent period, the price increase was actually fully due to inflation rather than demand.
Without the increase in demand, the expansion of production will result in **excess inventory** and **capacity** and **the firm will decrease production**, **layoff workers** and **reduce CapEx**, which in turn exacerbate the economic cycle.

## Roles and desirable qualities of the central bank
### Roles of central banks
There are several key roles of central banks:
- **Sole supplier of money** - traditionally backed by gold but gold backing was removed and money supplied by the central bank was deemed legal tender by law (i.e. fiat money). As long as fiat money holds its value over time and is acceptable for transactions, it can continue to serve as a medium of exchange.
- **Banking services to the government and other banks** in the economy - "lender of last resort", supply money to banks which are short of money
- **Regulator and supervisor of the banking and payment systems** - regulate the banking system by **imposing standards** of **risk taking** allowed and **reserve requirements** of banks under its jurisdiction. **Oversee the payment system** to ensure smooth operations of the **domestic clearing system** and in conjunction with other central banks for **international transactions**.
- **Holder of hold and foreign reserves**
- **Conductor of monetary policy** - the central bank controls/influences the quantity of money supplied and the growth of money supply

### Central bank objectives
**Primary objectives of central bank**:
- **Control inflation and promote price stability** - keeping inflation close to a stated target rate (i.e. 2-3% in developed countries) However, US FED and the Bank of Japan do not.
	- US FED additional goals: maximum employment, moderate long-term interest rates
	- Bank of Japan: deflation has been a bigger problem than inflation

Most developed nations:
- monetary policy can be quite effective to regulate the supply of money in their economy â‡’ Inflation targets can often be met.

However, most **developing nations may have some difficulty in using monetary policy** to control inflation, some of the common reasons include:
- **absence of a sufficiently liquid government bond market**
- **rapidly changing economy**
- **poor track record in controlling inflation in the past (making monetary policy intentions less credible)**
- **unwillingness of governments to grant genuine independence to the central bank**

Instead of depending solely on monetary policy, some central banks rely on pegging their exchange rate against a major currency, primarily the U.S. dollar.

This involves setting a **fixed level or range for the exchange rate against the dollar**, with the central bank **supporting the target by buying and selling the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets**.

The basic idea is that by tying a domestic economy's currency to that of an economy with a good track record on inflation, the domestic economy would effectively **import the inflation experience** of the low inflation economy.

Suppose that economic activity in the developing economy starts to rise rapidly, such that domestic inflation rises above the level in the United States. With a freely floating exchange rate regime, the currency of the developing economy would start to fall against the dollar.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.46.06.png]]


To arrest this fall, the Developing Economies Monetary Authority sells its foreign currency reserves and buys its own currency such that the peg to the US dollar is maintained. This has the effect of reducing the domestic money supply and increasing short term interest rates.
The developing economy experiences a monetary policy tightening, which is expected to bring down inflation.

This is because actions by the central bank to maintain the peg causes adjustments to the money supply and short term interest rates, which act to bring inflation closer to that of the US economy. This domestic money supply and interest rates can become more volatile.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.46.32.png]]

### Desirable qualities of central bank
For a central bank to succeed in controlling inflation, it should have 3 essential qualities:
- **Independence** - free from political interference, best that political parties do not interfere
	- **operational independence** - allowed to independently determine the policy rate
	- **target independence** - defines how inflation is computed, sets target inflation level, determines target achievement horizons
- **Credibility** - how businesses and households perceive the central banks will and ability to follow through on their stated intentions
	- credible central bank's targets can become self-fulfilling prophecies, if the market believes that a central bank is serious about achieving a target
- **Transparency** - regularly disclose the state of the economy by issuing inflation reports.
	- Such reports disclosed to the public the central bank's views on the range of indicators that they watch when they come to their monthly interest rate decision. By explaining their views on the economy and by being transparent in decision making, the central bank seeks to gain reputation and credibility.

This makes it easier for them to influence inflation expectations.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.46.53.png]]

## Monetary policy
Primary objective of most central banks is to maintain price stability with monetary policy. 

### Monetary policy tools
The 3 main policy tools of central banks are:
- **Reserve requirement**
- **Policy rate ("Official interest rate"/"Benchmark rate")**
- **Open market operations**

### Expansionary vs. contractionary policy
When inflation is too low, the central bank would want to raise aggregate demand through **expansionary monetary policies**. 

Conversely, if **inflation** is too high, the central bank tries to reduce aggregate demand through **contractionary monetary policies.**

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 17.24.27.png]]

#### Reserve requirement
In fractional banking system, the **reserve requirement** is the **% of deposits banks are required to retain as reserves**.

|Policy type|Expansionary policy|Contractionary policy|
|----|----|----|
|Reserve requirement|â†“|â†‘|
|Funds available for lending|â†‘|â†“|
|Interest rate|â†“|â†‘|

The effectiveness of reserve requirement varies:
- **Developed countries** - have not been using reserve requirement as banks seldom lend to the extent that the reserve requirement has hit
- **Developing countries** -  control lending as demand for capital is high, the reserve requirement tool is arguably more effective in regulating market interest rates in developing countries.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 16.52.48.png]]

#### Policy rate
**Policy rate** is also known as **"official interest rate/benchmark rate"**:
- to influence the market interest rate â‡’ real economic activity
- the interest rate that the central bank lends money to commercial banks at for short-term loan through a **repurchase agreement**.
	- The central bank purchases securities from banks that in turn agree to repurchase the securities at a higher price that's equal to the **principal + the interest (policy rate)**

Policy rate is named differently across countries:
- **two-week repo rate** - The Bank of England policy rate
- **refinancing rate** - The European Central Bank rate
- **discount rate** - In the US, the rate at which banks can borrow funds from the Fed. However, the most important interest rate used in U.S. monetary policy is not the discount rate, but the **Fed funds rate**.

**Fed funds rate** is the rate that banks charge each other on overnight loans of reserves. The Fed sets a **target (fed funds rate)** for this market determined rate and **uses open market operations** to move it to the target rate.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 17.13.02.png]]

#### Mechanism of policy rate in control price level
The **neutral interest rate** is the **growth rate** of the money supply that neither increases nor decreases the **economic growth rate**. **Trend rate** is the economy's long-term sustainable real growth rate, which can be estimated by adding the **central bank's inflation target** to the **real trend rate of economic growth**.

The **neutral interest rate** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Neutral\,interest\,rate=Inflation\,target+Real\,trend\,rate\,of\,economic\,growth}$$
The trend rate is not directly observable, must be estimated and also changes over time as structural conditions of the economy change. Structural shift in the economy would reduce the trend rate (e.g. after a prolonged period of heavy debt, U.S. consumers may reduce consumption in order to reduce their levels of debt)

When the **policy rate is below the neutral interest rate** (i.e. policy rate < neutral interest rate), the monetary policy is set to be **expansionary**.

For example, if the central bank wants to boost money supply to increase the inflation rate, it can set the policy rate at 4%. A lower rate reduces **banks cost of funds**, which **tends to decrease interest rates overall**.

Conversely, **contractionary policy** is to set a **higher policy rate** (i.e. policy rate > neutral interest rate), which decreases lending and increases interest rates.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 17.21.28.png]]

#### Open market operation
**Open market operations** is the buying and selling of government bonds by the central bank. 

In **expansionary monetary policy**, the central bank buys government bonds from commercial banks, **cash replaces securities, so banks of excess cash reserves**, more funds are available for lending, the money supply increases and interest rates decrease.

**Contractionary monetary policy** is when central bank sells government bonds, which have the opposite effect, reducing cash reserves in commercial banks, and reduces the funds available for lending and the money supply, which will tend to cause interest rates to increase.

In the **U.S. Open market** operations by the Federal Reserve is the most commonly used monetary tool to achieve the **Fed Funds Rate**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 17.23.03.png]]

#### Source of inflation
One important aspect that central banks have to consider before implementing monetary policies is the source of inflation.

Suppose that inflation is rising beyond its target, the central bank should determine if it is:
- **Cost push inflation** - food/energy prices increase; as the economy is at below full-employment equilibrium, contractionary monetary policy may cause even higher unemployment, which is harmful to the economy.
- **Demand-pull inflation**  

### Monetary transmission system
**Monetary transmission mechanism** is how monetary policies transmit through the economy and eventually affect the aggregate price level and inflation.

There are 4 channels which a change in the policy rate is transmitted to prices:
- **Market interest rates**
- **Asset prices (bonds, equities, real estates)**
- **Consumer and business confidence**
- **Currency exchange rates**

To summarize, central banks hope that by adjusting the **policy rate**, the **growth of money supply** changes, which hopefully translates to a change in **market interest rates**, which affects the amount of **borrowing and lending**, which hopefully brings the **desired change in aggregate demand** and eventually trickles down to **price levels**.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.10.00.png]]

## Limitations of monetary policy
**Monetary transmission mechanism** is how changes in the **policy rate** **affect price levels** and **inflation**. The most important is perhaps **market interest rates.**

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.12.06.png]]

To summarize, central banks hope that by adjusting the **policy rate**, the **growth of money supply** changes, which hopefully translates to a change in **market interest rates**, which affects the amount of **borrowing and lending**, which hopefully brings the **desired change in aggregate demand** and eventually trickles down to **price levels**.

There are many assumptions in this mechanism, which means there are many places for things to go wrong.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 02.04.58.png]]

There are 3 major assumptions:
- Long-term and short-term interest rate move in the same direction
- Money demand curve is downward sloping
- Banks are always willing to lend out their excess reserves

Limitation:
- Monetary policy is ineffective for deflationary environment

### Assumption 1: Long-term and short-term interest rate move in the same direction
If the central bank aims to lower inflation by raising the policy rate, the most immediate and obvious effect is that **short term interest rates** will increase as the policy rate directly affects the **bank's cost of funds.**

**Bond market vigilantes** is a group of market participants (individuals or businesses) who oppose the actions and intentions of the central bank due to their concerns about potential long-term consequences:
- they believe that **expansionary monetary policies** **(intention from central bank is to decrease interest rate)** **may lead to higher long-term interest rates**, if bond market participants anticipate future inflation rates to rise as a result of the expansionary policy.
- hold the belief that the central bank's **contractionary actions could result in lower long-term economic growth and inflation**, leading to a decrease in long-term interest rates due to a lower inflation premium.
- When the **central bank increases the policy rate**, **bond market vigilantes demand more long-term bonds as they expect significant slowdown in long-term economic growth**. This increased demand for long-term bonds causes long-term interest rates to fall.
- 
![[Screenshot 2023-05-18 at 02.07.23.png]]

### Assumption 2: Money demand curve is downward sloping 
The central bank **affects the equilibrium market interest rate** by **adjusting the money supply** and to lower the market interest rates, the central bank tries to **increase the money supply**.

However, in very extreme instances, there may be occasions where the demand for money becomes infinitely elastic, where the demand curve is horizontal and individuals are willing to hold additional money balances without any change in the interest rate.

Further increase in **money supply** **will not serve to lower interest rates** or affect real activity.

**Liquidity trap**, where monetary policy can become completely ineffective since it cannot affect the market interest rate and usually due to a deflationary environment.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.19.00.png]]

### Monetary policy is ineffective to counter deflation
The **ineffectiveness of monetary policy to counter deflation**. Compared to inflation, deflation is more difficult for central banks to reverse.

The central bank is limited to reducing the nominal policy rate to zero once it reaches zero (e.g. Japan interest rate close to zero for decades, still having difficulty in getting out from deflation).

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.19.23.png]]

### Assumption 3: Banks are always willing to lend out their excess reserve
We've seen in the 2008 financial crisis that this is not true under **extreme fear and uncertainty**, many US banks refuse to lend, even though the Fed will supply them with cheap money.

With short term rates near zero, economic growth still poor banks wary of lending and a real threat of deflation, central banks began to take drastic measures.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.19.34.png]]A policy rate cut may not increase borrowing or lending as the banks are not forced to lend.

A policy rate cut may not increase price levels as long-term interest rates may rise as long-term inflation expectation is raised. Higher long-term rates may decrease demand for long-term assets like property, causing a fall in price.

### Quantitative Easing I and Quantitative Easing I 
Under a policy terms, **quantitative easing**, billions of dollars were made available each month for the Fed to buy assets other than short term Treasury securities.

Central bank **buying large amounts of mortgage securities** from US commercial banks to encourage bank lending and to reduce mortgage rates in an attempt to revive the housing market, which had collapsed.

When this program did not have the desired effect, a **second round of quantitative easing** was initiated (i.e. QEII).

The Fed **purchased long term Treasury bonds** in large quantities with the goal of **bringing down longer term interest rates** and generating excess reserves to increase lending and economic growth.

The Fed has also **purchased securities with credit risk (i.e. risky bonds)** as part of its quantitative easing, improving banks, balance sheets, all these purchases have the effect of flushing banks with cash such that they can lend at lower interest rates, bringing about increased demand and economic recovery.

## Fiscal policy
### Roles and objectives
**Fiscal policy** refers to a **government's use of spending and taxation** to meet **macroeconomic goals**. The **primary objective** for fiscal policy is **economic stability**.

**Secondary objectives**:
- Redistribute wealth/income among segments of the population
- Allocate resources among sectors in the economy

### Keynesian view vs. monetarist
**Keynesian** economists:
- believe that fiscal policy have a strong effect on economic growth when the economy is operating at less than full employment
- for long and deep recessions, government intervention in the form of expansionary fiscal policy is necessary to save the economy

**Monetarist** economist:
- believes fiscal stimulus is only temporary
- they believe money supply has the greatest effect on the economy
- monetary policy should be steady and predictable in order to maintain price stability

### Government budget
A **government budget** is the tax revenue minus the government spending.
The government budget is:
$$\mathrm{Government\,budget=Tax\,revenue-Government\,spending}$$
**Balanced budget** when tax revenues equal government spending (i.e. spending = tax)
**Budget surplus** is when government tax revenues exceed spending (i.e. spending < tax)
**Budget deficit** is when spending exceeds tax revenues (i.e. spending > tax).

### Expansionary vs. Contractionary
In general, **budget deficit** is created by **lower taxes** and **higher government spending**:
- increasing aggregate demand
- increase economic growth
- increase employment

Conversely, budget surplus is created by **higher taxes** and **lower government spending**:
- decrease aggregate demand
- decrease economic growth
- decrease employment

**Note** that running a budget surplus does not necessarily mean the fiscal policy is contractionary, nor does the budget deficit mean the fiscal policy is expansionary.

Rather, economists often focus **on the change** **in the surplus or deficit** to determine if the fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary, an increase in surplus is indicative of a contractionary fiscal policy. Similarly, an increase in deficit is indicative of an expansionary fiscal policy.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 23.37.21.png]]

#### Structural budget deficit
Economists often use a measure called the **structural budget deficit** to gauge fiscal policy. This is the deficit that would occur based on current policies **if the economy were at full employment**.

Let's say an economy, **structural budget deficit** is estimated to be at this level. If the actual budget runs at this level, it can be said that the **fiscal policy is neutral.**

#### Automatic stabilisers for contractionary fiscal policy
**Automatic stabilisers** are **built in fiscal devices triggered by the state of the economy**. 
e.g., if the economy â†“ and unemployment â†‘, taxes â†“ because of lower income earned and unemployment payouts will increase, both of which increases the budget deficit. **Notice that even without any government intervention, the fiscal position is automatically expansionary.**


![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 23.41.53.png]]

#### Discretionary contractionary fiscal policy
**Discretionary contractionary fiscal policy** is when the government intentionally seeks to **further increase the deficit** by:
- **increasing spending on infrastructure projects**
- **lowering the tax rate** to increase aggregate demand 
to counter the economic slowdown.

#### Automatic stabilisers for contractionary fiscal policy
**Automatic stabilisers** that prevent the economy from overheating during boom times, **higher tax revenues**, coupled with **lower payouts for social programs**, **tend to decrease budget deficits**.

#### Discretionary expansionary fiscal policy
**Discretionary expansionary fiscal policy** is when the government takes additional steps to cool demand by:
- raising tax rates
- curbing spending

### Limitations of discretionary fiscal policy
The **main criticism** regarding **discretionary fiscal policy** is that complications arise in practice that **delay its implementation and impact** on the economy. The lag between recessionary or inflationary conditions in the economy and the impact on the economy or fiscal policy changes can be divided into 3 stages:
- **Recognition lag** - it takes time to recognise the nature and extent of the economic problem
- **Action lag** - discuss, vote on and implement fiscal policy changes
- **Impact lag** - the time between the implementation of fiscal policy changes and when the impact of the changes on the economy actually takes place, and takes time for corporations and individuals to act on the fiscal policy changes and fiscal multiplier effects take time to propagate as well

e.g., if policy makers identify that the economy is in a recession and they subsequently implement expansionary fiscal policy to counter it, however, by the time the policy has its full impact, the economy may already be on a path to recovery and the expansionary policy may aggravate inflationary pressures on the economy

![[Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 23.52.07.png]]

There are **other limitations with discretionary fiscal policy**:
- **Misreading economic statistics** - policy makers can be misled and apply the inappropriate fiscal policy (e.g. if policymakers think economy is below full employment when it actually is above, applying expansionary policy with increase inflationary pressure)
- **Limit to budget deficit** - funding the deficit will be problematic as this could lead to â†‘ interest rates, which could lead to â†“ demand and â†“ consumption in the economy
- **Crowding out effect** -  if the government borrows heavily to fund its expansionary fiscal policies, the cost of borrowing may rise and the private sector may cut back on investments, will choke off private investment and reduce the intended impact of fiscal policy changes on aggregate demand. (Increased budget deficits will increase the demand for loanable funds and lead to higher interest rates and thus lower private investment)
- **Resource constraints** - e.g. labor shortage are not due to low demand, expansionary fiscal policy will have limited effect as production cannot increase
- **Cannot address high unemployment and high inflation at the same time** - e.g. High unemployment requires expansionary policy to counter, while high inflation requires contractionary policy to counter.

## Fiscal policy tools
### Fiscal policy tools
Government fiscal policy uses **spending (spending tools)** and **taxes (revenue tools)** to achieve its macroeconomic goals. Besides these direct effects, announcing a change in fiscal policy may have significant effects on expectations.

e.g., an announcement of future increase in personal income tax may immediately reduce current consumption, rapidly producing the desired goal of reducing aggregate demand.

#### Spending (Spending tools)
**Spending tools** include:
- **Transfer payments** - provide minimum level of income for low-income, and change income distribution (not included in GDP calculation as not a reward for productivity)
	- e.g. social security benefits, unemployment benefits
- **Current spending** - government spending on an ongoing and routine basis â‡’ â†‘ skill level, â†‘ productivity
	- e.g. health, education, defence spending
- **Capital spending** - government spending on infrastructure â‡’ â†‘ productivity
	- e.g. schools, public transport, and hospitals

**Justification for government spending**:
- Provide basic services (e.g. defence) that benefit all citizens equally
- Provide minimum standard of living for the poor, and hence redistribute income and wealth
- Building of infrastructure like airports can help boost economic growth
- Support growth and unemployment targets by directly affecting aggregate demand
- Subsidise development of innovative products to propel future growth

##### Disadvantages of spendings
There are several disadvantage for spending tools:
- **Transfer payments** take time to implement delaying the impact of fiscal policy.
- **Capital spending** can take an even longer time to implement as infrastructure projects require years of planning and implementation. By the time the fiscal impact of an infrastructure project is felt, the economy may have recovered.

#### Tax (Revenue tools)
Government revenues can take the form of **direct taxes** and **indirect taxes**. Taxes can be justified both in terms of **raising revenues** to **finance expenditures** and in terms of **income and wealth redistribution policies**.

**Direct taxes** are levied on income and wealth, include:
- personal income taxes
- corporate income taxes
- national insurance taxes
- capital gains taxes
- property tax
- inheritance tax

**Indirect taxes** are levied on goods and services, include:
- sales taxes
- value added taxes
- excise taxes (e.g. tobacco and alcohol tax) - can be used to reduce consumption of some goods and service

Economists typically consider 4 desirable attributes of a tax policy:
- **Simplicity** - ease of compliance and enforcement, should be certain and not easily manipulated
- **Efficiency** - having the least interference in the choices individuals make in the marketplace, it should also not act as a deterrent to people working hard to earn a high income
- **Fairness** - horizontal equality, where people in similar situations should pay similar taxes and vertical equality, richer people should pay more in taxes
- **Sufficiency** - taxes should generate sufficient revenues to meet the spending needs of the government.

##### Benefits of tax:
- **Indirect taxes** can be quickly implemented, easily increase the government's revenue without much cost to the government.
- social policies can be implemented very quickly via **excise taxes** - e.g. the government can increase tobacco tax to discourage smoking

##### Disadvantage of tax:
- **Direct taxes** take time to implement delaying the impact of fiscal policy

### Policy effect calculations
It's important to note that not all fiscal policy tools affect aggregate demand equally.

#### Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
Spending tools are more effective in increasing aggregate demand, tax reductions are somewhat less effective due to the **marginal propensity to consume effect (MPC)**.

The **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)** is the proportion that an individual or business spends for every additional dollar of disposable income. The low income may likely have a higher NPC as they tend to spend a larger proportion of income on consumption. As such, the government may get better results by focusing the tax cuts on the low income.

In contrast, when the government spends a hundred million dollars on goods and services, the entire 100 million dollars goes into the economy.

#### Fiscal multiplier
When the government spend money on goods and services, the net effect on aggregate demand is multiplied by **fiscal multiplier** factor.
  
When the government spends money in the economy, this amount goes to **companies and individuals who provided the goods and services**. There will be disposable income after companies and individuals tax. The company and individuals will be spending goods and services on other goods and services in the economy. This cycle continues until the effect reaches a limit. The total spending in the economy is multiplied beyond the amount of government spending. The fiscal multiplier means that with a certain amount of government spending can have a multiplier effect of a certain amount.

The equation for the **fiscal multiplier** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Fiscal\,multiplier=\frac{1}{1-MPC(1-T)}}$$
where MPC: marginal propensity to consume; t: tax rate.

When the government wishes to maintain its current budget, increased spending has to be balanced by a corresponding increase in revenue from taxes.

When the marginal propensity to consume is in effect, the disposable income of the economy falls by an amount, the actual decrease in spending is with the marginal propensity to consume.
Therefore, there will be a net positive amount for the aggregate demand. Even though the fiscal budget remains unchanged, the net change in aggregate demand is positive. The **balanced budget multiplier** is positive in this case.

#### Ricardian equivalence
**Ricardian equivalence** is the limit on the impact of the government's efforts to increase aggregate demand since **expansionary fiscal policy** usually involves **widening the budget deficit**, a faster and heavier impact on aggregate demand. However, **increases in the budget deficit also mean growing the national debt**, which eventually has to be repaid, **possibly through higher taxes in the future**. 

If taxpayers recognise that they may have to pay higher taxes in the future, they **may** **reduce consumption in anticipation**.

**However, if taxpayers underestimate their future liability for repaying the debt so that aggregate demand is increased by equal spending and tax increases, Ricardian equivalence does not hold.**

### Concerns over large deficits
**Debt ratio** (debt-to-GDP) is national debt measured relative to the annual GDP.
The **debt ratio equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,ratio=\frac{National\,debt}{GDP}}$$

Economist debates whether a large national debt is a matter of concern.

The **real interest rate (r)** on the government's debt:
- if  **real interest rate (r)**>**real growth rate (g)** of the economy, the debt ratio â†‘
- if  **real interest rate (r)**>**real growth rate (g)** of the economy, the debt ratio â†“

There are two opposing views on **high debt ratio**.
High debt ratio is a concern because of these reasons:
- **Higher future taxes** - disincentive to work/innovate, lower long-term growth
- **Investor lose confidence, refuse to refinance debt** - default on foreign currency debt, print money to service local debt, higher inflation
- **Increased interest rates** - private sector reduce borrowing and investments (crowding-out effect)

High debt ratio is not a concern because of these reasons:
- **Not a big problem is debt is primarily held by citizens**
- **Future economic gains from capital investments are sufficient to payoff debt**
- **Motivate governments to push for needed tax reforms**
- **If Ricardian equivalence holds, private sector savings can offset government deficit**

Contractionary monetary policy increases the cost of borrowing for private firms, causing the private sector to reduce capital investments.  
Expansionary fiscal policy increases government spending, thus increasing the public sectorâ€™s share of the GDP.
