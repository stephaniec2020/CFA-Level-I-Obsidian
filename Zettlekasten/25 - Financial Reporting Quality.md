## Conceptual Overview
### Objective of financial reporting
"_to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is **useful** to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity_"

In order to be **useful**, it has to be of high-quality financial reporting, which some of the measures have to be met:
- **GAAP-compliant** (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals or International Financial Reporting Standards)
- **Decision-useful information** 
	- **Relevant** - information is useful to users (e.g. should be useful to the users of the financial statements to make investment or credit decisions)
	- **Faithful representation** - information is complete, neutral and error-free
- **Quality Earnings** - This term is broadly used to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items.
	- **Sustainable** - â†‘ earnings due to â†‘ efficiency or â†‘ market share, however, unsustainable could be increase in profits due to one-off sales
	- **Sufficient** - measured by return on invested capital (ROIC), Sufficiency is an important measure of earnings quality as it is required to sustain the business pay off debt holders and provide returns to shareholders.

### Quality spectrum of financial reports
![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 02.14.10.png]]
The quality of a firm's earnings is considered to be low if they are not sustainable or if they are not of a sufficient level to provide an adequate return to investors. When financial reports do not conform with GAAP, the user cannot evaluate the quality of earnings in terms of adequacy or sustainability.

Financial reports that are of low quality make it difficult or impossible for users of the statements to assess the quality of the firm's earnings, cash flows, and balance sheet values.

## Context for misreporting
There are 3 factors that typically exist in cases where the management provides low-quality financial reporting, they are:
- **Motivation** - that can influence management decisions
- **Opportunity** - for the management to misreport
- **Rationalisation of the behaviour** - depends much on the management circumstances and personal principles

#### Motivations
It can be seen as carrot and the stick situation:
- **Career motivation** - enhance personal reputation through **beating benchmarks**
- **Bonuses** - when the **stock price increase** due to positive earnings surprises
- **Company reputation** - investors, customers, suppliers more confident in the company's management
- **Debt covenants** - violation can have **severe consequences** on a company's financing (Debt covenants are usually there to make sure the companyâ€™s performance is adequate. Â Management should be motivated to over-report earnings to avoid violating debt covenants, not under-report.)
- **Defer earnings** - **less pressure** to keep up with outperformance in future periods

#### Opportunities
The low-quality report could only be produced when given the opportunities such as:
- Weak internal controls
- Inadequate supervision
- Standards with loopholes and inadequate penalties

#### Rationalisation 
When there are sufficient motivations and when there are opportunities to exploit, the final hurdle for a management to cross is rationalisation.

## Disciplinary measures
In every country, there's a regulatory body responsible for publicly traded securities and the markets in which they trade. 

**Regulatory authorities**:
- SEC is the regulatory body for publicly traded securities in the US
- European Securities and Markets Authority (EMSA) is a regional authority that coordinates policy among regulators in the European Union
- The LOSCO is an international body that works towards uniform financial regulations across countries

#### Issuance of new publicly traded securities requirements
Securities regulations typically require a registration process for the issuance of new publicly traded securities, specific disclosure and reporting requirements including:
- **periodic financial statements**
- **disclosure and accompanying notes**
- **independent audit** of financial reports
- **statement of financial condition** made by the **management**
- **signed statement by the person responsible for the preparation of the financial reports**
- a review process for newly registered securities and periodic reviews after registration
A mechanism to discipline financial reporting quality for securities that trade **in the United States** that is not typically imposed on security issuers elsewhere is that:
- **management must attest to the effectiveness of the firmâ€™s internal controls**.


**Note** that an unqualified or clean audit opinion is not a guarantee that no fraud has occurred. It only offers reasonable assurance that the financial reports have been fairly reported with respect to the applicable standards.

#### Enforcement actions
**Enforcement actions** are being taken when the company was found out to be committing fraud in reporting, and the forms of enforcement actions include:
- Fines
- Suspensions 
- Public disclosure of the results of disciplinary proceedings
- Criminal prosecutions

#### Discipline on financial reporting quality in private contract
Another source of discipline on financial reporting quality is private contracts such as those with lenders. Such contracts will often specify how financial measures referenced in the loan covenants will be calculated. The counter-parties to private contracts with the firm have an incentive to see that the firm produces high-quality financial reports.

"_By borrowing from you, I agree that (financial measure) shall be calculated in accordance to (method of calculation)..._"

## Accounting bias and earnings manipulation
Biased reporting is undesirable as it renders the financial report not decision useful. This in turn means that an analyst cannot make meaningful conclusions regarding the earnings quality of a firm. Biased reporting can come in the form of conservative accounting or aggressive accounting.

### Conservative vs aggressive bias
Ideally, financial statements should be neutral or unbiased in order to offer the most value to analysts. Both conservative and aggressive biases are deviation from unbiased reporting.

**Conservative accounting** tend to:
- â†“ the company's reported earnings
- â†“ financial position for the current period
- â†‘ future period earnings
and conservative accounting:
- is not better than aggressive 
- faithful representation is violated
- reduced usefulness

**Aggressive accounting** tend to:
-  â†‘ reported earnings
-  â†‘ the financial position for the current period
-  â†“ future period earnings

Both these types of bias are sometimes used by management to smooth earnings over time. **Smoother earnings** reduce the volatility of the company's share price.

**Earnings smoothing** is accomplished through adjustment of accrued liabilities that are based on management estimates. During periods of higher than expected earnings, management may employ a **conservative bias** to have lower reported earnings. Whereas during periods of lower than expected earnings, management may employ **aggressive bias** to adjust **higher reported earnings**.

### Earnings manipulation
There are other ways of managing the earnings, such as:
- **Revenue recognition**
- **Current period costs**
- **Depreciation method**
- **Residual value of depreciable asset**
- **Useful life of depreciable assets**
- **Recognition of Amortisation/Impairment**
- **Inventory cost flow method**
- **Bad debt reserves**
- **Valuation allowance**
and will be discussed in detail below.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 03.04.53.png]]

#### Revenue recognition
Depending on the accounting practice, revenue can be delayed to â†“ income and bring forward to â†‘ income for the current period. For example, the management can choose where in the shipping process the customer is deemed to have received the goods.
This is known as the **free-on-onboard** point.

As revenue is typically recorded when the customer has received the goods, choosing the free-on-board point at the source, means that the revenue will be recognized earlier. Conversely, choosing the free-on-board point at the destination means that the revenue is recognized later.

Firms can also manage the timing of revenue recognition by accelerating or delaying the shipment of goods. If additional revenue is required to meet targets, firms can offer discounts or special financing terms to increase orders in the current period.

Some firms even ship goods to distributors without receiving an order, overloading a distribution channel like this is known as **channel stuffing**. The opposite can also happen where firms choose to hold or delay customer shipments. This delays recognition of revenue to the next period.

In a **bill-and-hold transaction**, the manufacturer sells the goods and issues an invoice, but the customer does not actually need to receive the goods yet. The manufacturer keeps the goods at its location, but records the sale on its income statement. Such fictitious bill and hold transactions can increase earnings in the current period as revenue is recognized for goods that are actually still in inventory. However, revenue for future periods will be decreased as real customer orders for these items are filled, but not recognized as revenue. This merely offsets the previous overstatement of revenue.

Besides those mentioned above, there are other warning signs for accounting bias in revenue recognition:
- Inconsistent **free-on-board** terms
- Signs of **channel stuffing**
- Use of **bill-and-hold** transactions
- **Changes in revenue recognition methods**
- Use of **barter** transactions
- Use of **rebate** programs that require estimation of the impact of rebates on net revenue
- **Lack of transparency** with regard to how the various components of a customer order are recorded as revenue
- Revenue growth out of line with **peer companies**
- **Declining receivables turnover** over multiple periods
- **Decreases in total asset turnover**, especially when a company is growing through acquisition of other companies
- Inclusion of **non-operating items** or significant one-time sales in revenue
- "pro forma" or non-GAAP measures of earnings.

#### Current period cost
Any cost that can be capitalised creates an asset on the balance sheet and the impact of this cost on net income can be spread over many years through depreciation expense. When a cost is expensed, however, the impact is the immediate reduction of net income.
So if a management wishes to increase net income of the firm for the current period with aggressive accounting bias, they would find ways to justify capitalising a cost that should have been expensed and vice versa.

Capitalisation also affects cash flow classifications. If an expense is capitalised, the entire amount is classified as an investing cash outflow. Operating cash flow is effectively increased by the same amount because of the difference in classification.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 23.49.56.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 23.55.24.png]]
Analysts should look out for instances where a firm capitalises costs that are typically not capitalised by firms in their industry. This may indicate an abuse of capitalisation policies.

#### Depreciation method
With regards to depreciation methods, estimated residual values or estimated useful lives, understand whether the company is doing accounting bias through:
- comparing the methods with those of peer companies
- carrying value of certain assets appear out of line with fair market value

When it comes to valuing PP&E, there are several avenues for earnings management by manipulating depreciation parameters. Firstly, the choice of depreciation method. 

Using the accelerated method of depreciation increases expenses and decreases net income in the early years of an asset's life. In the later years, expenses are lower and net income higher when compared to the straight line method.

Therefore, management may be inclined to choose the accelerated method for newly purchased assets if the intention is to report lower net income for the current period.

Conversely, the straight line methods will be preferred if the management wishes to report higher net income in the early years.

#### Residual value of depreciable asset
Changing the residual value can also affect net income and the carrying value of the asset.
A smaller residual value will hasten depreciation so the carrying value of the asset is lower, depreciation expenses greater and net income is lower.

Conversely, a larger residual value will have the opposite effects. Reported net income will be higher if the management increases the residual values of assets on the firm's balance sheet.

This is, however, not without repercussions. If the residual value is higher than the actual sale price at the end of the asset's life, a loss on the sale of the asset will decrease net income in the period when the asset is sold.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 23.56.02.png]]

#### Useful life of depreciable assets
Likewise, changing the estimates of the useful life of a depreciable asset can also affect the net income and carrying value of the asset.

Using a shorter estimated useful life of a depreciable asset increases the periodic depreciation expense and decreases net income in the early years of the asset's life.
A longer estimated useful life will have the opposite effect and increased net income in the early years. 

#### Recognition of Amortisation/Impairment
Unlike depreciation expense, which pretty much follows a predefined method and schedule, management has more leeway when it comes to determining when to recognise amortisation or impairments and the amount that is recognized.

#### Inventory cost flow method
There are 3 methods of inventory cost calculation:
- LIFO - conservative accounting bias
- FIFO - aggressive accounting bias
- Weighted average cost method - between LIFO and FIFO

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 00.02.20.png]]

Warning signs of inventory cost flow method:
- Pattern of **declining inventory turnover ratio** - could indicate aggressive accounting to lower down COGS
- **LIFO liquidation** (older, lower cost inventory liquidated) - lower COGS

However, changing the cost flow method will not smooth out earnings in the long run.

#### Bad debt reserves
**Bad debt reserves** are another avenue or earnings manipulation. Accounts receivable are an asset on a firm's balance sheet, accounting for the revenue that has been earned, but the payment not yet received. In practice, however, not all of the receivables are collectable. This is known as **bad debt.**

For each period, the management adjusts this reserve according to its estimates of bad debt. A decrease in the reserve for bad debt will increase net receivables reported on the balance sheet. This has the effect of reducing expenses on the income statement and hence, increase the net income. An increase in the allowance for bad debt would have the opposite effect, increasing expenses and decreasing net income.

This mechanism allows the management to smooth earnings. In periods of high earnings, the allowance for bad debt is increased to reduce reported earnings in effect storing these earnings for later use.

In subsequent periods, if earnings are below benchmark values, the bad debt reserve can be reduced to meet earnings targets. Other reserves recorded by a company such as a reserve for **warranty expense** can also be changed to manage reported earnings.

Warning sign of bad debt reserves:
- bad debts reserve, as a % of the gross accountings receivable, differ significantly from that of peer companies

#### Valuation allowance
Another example of accounting that can be used to manage earnings is a **valuation allowance**.

**Valuation allowance** reduces the carrying value of a deferred tax asset based on the probability it will not be realised. Similar to the effects of an allowance for bad debt, decreasing a valuation allowance will increase the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and increase net income for the period.

Conversely, an increase in the valuation allowance, will decrease the net deferred tax asset and reduce net income for the period. As with the contract account for bad debt, the valuation allowance can be understated and overstated over time to smooth earnings.

### Cash flow manipulation
Another area of manipulations is on the reported cash flow. Primarily, the goal is to increase the reported cash flow from operations (CFO).

Avenues that can be exploited include:
- delay payment to suppliers, commonly referred to as stretching payables - A significant increase in days payables may indicate that payables have been "stretched" (not paid or paid more slowly), which increases operating cash flow in an unsustainable manner and calls the quality of the reported cash flow values into question. Stretching payables does not affect earnings because the related expenses were recognized in the period incurred. An increase in days payables will decrease net working capital, other things equal.

Companies that report under **IFRS** can choose to classify:
- **interest and dividends** paid as either CFO or CFF
- **interest and dividends** received as either CFI or CFO
- Â interest expense if capitalised, will decrease CFI and increase CFO - This is coupled with its effects on the pattern of earnings from depreciating the interest expense over time rather than expensing it all in the current period

## Other warning signs
There are also other warning signs where analyst should be careful of:
- **4th quarter earnings** show a pattern that is inconsistent with the seasonality of earnings for the industry
- The firm has significant transactions with **related parties of the management**
- Certain expenses are classified as **non-recurring but appear regularly** in financial reports 
- **Gross or operating profit margins are noticeably higher** than peer companies
- Management provides only **minimal financial reporting information and disclosure**
- Management typically emphasises **non-GAAP earning measures**
- Pursues growth by **purchasing a large number of businesses**
- Ratio of **operating cash flow to net income** is persistently less than one, or declining over time.
- Capitalising purchases that other firms expense increases reported CFO by classifying the cash outflows as CFI. Revenue recognition methods and accounting estimates may affect reported income but are unlikely to affect the amount or classification of cash flows.
- Some accounting principles, such as IFRS and U.S. GAAP standards for expensing **research costs and recognising probable litigation losses, reflect conservatism** rather than neutrality, in that they require earlier recognition of probable losses and later recognition of probable gains.
