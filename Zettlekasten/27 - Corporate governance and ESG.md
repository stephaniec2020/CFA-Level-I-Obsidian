## Corporate governance overview and stakeholder groups
### Definition
**Corporate governance**, which the CFA Institute defines as "the system of internal controls and procedures by which individual companies are managed. It provides a **framework** that defines the **rights, roles, and responsibilities of various groups within an organisation**. At its core, corporate governance is the arrangement of **checks, balances, and incentives** a company needs in order to minimise and manage the **conflicting interests between insiders and external shareowners**."

### Theory of corporate governance 
There are two major theories of corporate governance:
- **Shareholder theory** - the primary focus is the interests of the firm's shareholders, which  is to maximize the value of the firm's common stock; primarily concerned with a conflict of interest between the firm's managers and the shareholders.
- **Stakeholder theory** - considers the conflicts **among the several groups** that have an interest in the activities and performance of the company; including shareholders, board of directors, management, employees, suppliers, and creditors among others. (Resolving the conflicting interests of both shareholders and other stakeholders is the focus of corporate governance under stakeholder theory. Shareholders are among the groups whose interests are considered under stakeholder theory.)

### Stakeholder groups
There are several stakeholders for a company: 
- **Shareholders**
- **Board of directors**
- **Management**
- **Employees**
- **Creditors**
- **Suppliers**

![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 21.06.34.png]]

### Shareholders
**Shareholders** are:
- the owners of the company
- their claim is on the net assets of the company, after all liabilities settled
- voting rights for the board of directors and corporate matters
- have an interest in the ongoing profitability and growth of the firm, both of which can increase the value of their shares

### Board of directors
**Board of directors**:
- have the responsibility to protect the interests of shareholders
- to hire, fire, and set the compensation of the firm's senior managers
- to set the strategic direction
- monitor financial performance and other aspects of the firm's ongoing activities

**Board structure**:
- Typically, some of the firm's senior executives serve on the board of directors, along with directors who are not otherwise employed by the company.
- **One-tier board structure** - both company executives and non-executive board members serve on a single board of directors.
- **Two-tier board structure** - the non-executive board members serve on a supervisory board that oversees a management board made up of company executives.

### Management
**The company management**:
- typically receive compensation, salary, a bonus (based on company performance), and perquisites (e.g. expense accounts, use of company planes, and special retirement benefits)
- continued employment and higher compensation
- their bonuses are usually tied, giving them a strong interest in meeting the targets

### Employees
The **employees**:
- have an interest in the sustainability and success of the firm
- job security, bonus (based on company performance , though to a much lesser extent.
- career advancement, training, and working conditions.

### Creditors
The **creditors** are primarily the banks and bondholders:
- not regarded as owners
- do not typically have voting rights in firm management
- do not participate in firm growth
- getting timely interest payments and principal repayments (sometimes protected to varying degrees by collaterals and covenants)

### Suppliers
The **suppliers**: 
- have an interest in preserving the ongoing relationship with the firm and in the profitability of the deals 
- short-term creditors of the firm, have an interest in the firm's solvency and ongoing financial strength

### Customers
**Customers** can also be considered as stakeholders, they:
- expect reliable and timely delivery of goods or services, ongoing support, product guarantees, and after-sale service
- long-term relationships customers - likely to have an interest in the stability of the company

### Government/regulator
**Governments and regulators**:
- have the duty to protect the interests of the general public
- ensure the wellbeing of the economy
- corporate taxes form a large portion of a government's revenue

## Relationship in corporate governance
### Principal-agent relationship
**Principal agent relationship ("agency relationship")** is when a **principal** **hires** **an agent** to **perform a particular task or service**.

An agent is obliged to act in the best interests of the principal. Conflicts arise when an agent's interests may not coincide exactly with those of the principal.

### Shareholders/directors/management relationship
**Shareholders** are the **principals** as they are firm owners, whilst the **firm management and directors** can be considered **agents hired to run the firm** and primary duty of directors and managers is to **act in the best the shareholders**.

There are several conflicts between shareholder, directors and management:
- Managers may **prioritise their personal compensation** over shareholders' interest
- **Conflict with respect to risk tolerance** - shareholder: well diversified portfolio; management: risk adverse as protecting their job and salary
- **Information asymmetry**
- **Board less effective in monitoring/control management actions and compensation** - in some situation where some board of directors are the managers of the company
- **Board might favour certain influential shareholders**

### Between shareholders
Conflicts between groups of shareholders can occur when a single shareholder or group of shareholders hold a majority of the votes or shares in the company, and they collectively disregard the interests of the minority shareholders.

There are several occasions where controlling vs minority shareholders:
- **Biased terms in a company acquisition**
- **Related-party transaction** - may exert their influence and not having the best interest in the company 
- **Different classes of common stock** - some might have higher voting power/rights even holding less percentage of the shares

### Shareholder vs creditors
Returns to shareholders increase as the company grows, whereas returns to creditors are mainly the fixed interest paid by the company.

There are several conflict of interest between shareholder and creditors:
- **Business risk** - the risk tolerance level of shareholders and creditors are different
- **Higher default risk by taking in new debt** - with growth, there might be capital needs for taking on new debt but it might create credit risk for old creditors
- **Distribution of excessive dividends** - might impairs the company's ability to pay interest and principal

### Shareholders vs customers
There might be conflict between customers and shareholders. A company may decide to raise prices or reduce product safety features to reduce costs.

### Shareholders vs government
A company may adopt accounting and reporting practices that reduce its tax burden. This benefits the shareholders, but there is less revenue for the government.

## Stakeholder management
**Stakeholder management** refers to the management of company relations with stakeholders and is based on having a good understanding of stakeholder interests and maintaining effective communication with stakeholders.

### Infrastructure of stakeholder management
The management of stakeholder relationships is based on 4 types of infrastructures:
- **Legal** - laws relevant to and the legal recourse of stakeholders when their rights are violated
- **Contractual** - contracts that spell out the rights and responsibilities of the company and the stakeholder
- **Organisational** - company's procedures, including its internal systems and practices on how to manage stakeholder relationships
- **Governmental** - regulations imposed on companies

### Annual general meeting (AGM)
Companies are generally required to hold an **annual general meeting (AGM)** within a certain period following the **end of their fiscal yea**r. 

At the AGM, the management:
- provides shareholders with the audited financial statements
- addresses the company's performance and significant actions over the period
- answers shareholder questions.

#### Voting for shareholders
Anyone who owns the company shares is permitted to attend, to speak, or to ask questions and to vote. A shareholder can miss the meeting and still vote by proxy, this person can be a director, member of management or the shareholder's investment advisor. A proxy may specify the shareholder's vote on the issues or leave the vote to the discretion of the assignee.

For resolutions:
- **Ordinary resolutions** - require simple majority (i.e. >50%) e.g. approval of auditor, election of directors
- **Special resolutions** - require super majority (i.e. >67% or 75%) e.g. approval of merger, amendments, can be called in extraordinary general meeting or also could happen in annual general meeting

![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 19.01.57.png]]

There are 2 types of voting systems:
- **Statutory voting system** - each share held is assigned one vote in the election of each board member
- **Cumulative voting system** - allowed to accumulate total votes to cast on any candidate, numerically majority shareholder is not assured to be able to decide on every board seat

### Board of director mechanisms
The **board of directors mechanisms** spells out the responsibilities of the directors:
- primarily act in the interest of shareholders
- ensure the proper governance of the company
- guiding managers on the company's strategic direction
- overseeing management's actions in implementing company strategy
- evaluating management performance and compensation.

### Audit function 
The audit function represents the systems, controls and procedures in place to **examine the company's operations and financial records**.

There are 2 types of audits:
- **Internal** - Internal audits are conducted by an independent internal audit unit.
- **External** - External auditors are also required to audit the company's annual financial records to provide reasonable assurance of their accuracy and fair representation of the company's financial position.

### Reporting and transparency mechanism
The **reporting and transparency mechanism** is to ensure that investors have access to:
- the company's financial and non-financial information through annual reports
- proxy statements
- timely disclosures

### Policies on related party transactions
**Policies on related party transactions** establish the procedures for mitigating, managing
and disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. Typically, directors and managers are required to disclose any conflict of interest they may have with the company.

### Remuneration policies
**Remuneration policies** dictate the terms of compensation for the company's management. 

Board of directors have the responsibility:
- setting and approving salary, bonuses and perquisites for the management.
- company incentive plan variable component that is contingent on the company performance (e.g. profit sharing, stocks or stock options)
- some regulators are also requiring companies to adopt clawback provisions - allow a company to recover previously paid remuneration if misconduct can be proven.

### Contractual agreements with creditor
The rights of creditors are **established by laws** and according to **contracts** executed with the company.

The **bond indenture** is a legal contract that describes
- **Bond structure**
- **Issuer obligations**
- **Bondholders' rights**
- **Covenants** - actions issuer is obligated to or prohibited from performing
- **Collaterals** - assets pledge by the company as a form of financial guarantee

To limit the risks to creditors, some of these agreements can include covenants which specify actions the issuer is obligated to or prohibited from performing.

### Employee laws and contracts 
Employee relations are often governed by:
- Employee laws and contracts - labour law dictates - basic employee rights (e.g. labor hours, pension, hiring and firing and vacation)
Employees also have the right to create **unions** to fight for better terms and working conditions.

### Contractual agreements with customers and suppliers
The **contracts** specify:
- the products and services
- the prices and the payment terms
- the rights and responsibilities of each party
- after-sale relationship
- any guarantees
- recourse available if either party breaches the terms of the contract

## Board of directors and committees
**Board of directors** is the central components of a company's governance structure, serving as the link between shareholders and the management.

### Board structures
Most **corporate governance** require companies to have a board with a **diverse mix** of expertise,
backgrounds, and competencies.

Board structure and composition of a board of directors vary by company and geography, and the number of directors may differ based on the company's size, structure, and complexity of operations.

The board structure should have:
- specialised knowledge of the company's industry
- expertise in certain functions (e.g. strategy, finance, audit, risk management, human resources, or legal)

#### One-tier board
In a **one tier board**, there is a single board of directors that includes:
- **Internal directors** - Executive directors - typically senior managers employed by the firm;
	- "CEO duality" - Chairman of the one-tier board of director can be the CEO as well
- **External directors** - Non-executive directors, can be employee representatives - which are elected by the company's employees; independent - no other relationship with the firm
	- Lead independent director - has the authority to call meetings of independent directors


![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 19.30.06.png]]

#### Two-tier board
In a two-tier board structure, the two board operate independently:
- Non-executive directors form the supervisory board - usually chaired by the independent chairman
- Executive directors form the management board - chaired by the CEO

![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 19.30.29.png]]

#### Election of board of directors
In **general practice**:
- all board member elections to be held at the same meeting
- the same board will serve for multiple years until the next election

With a **staggered board**:
- just a few board positions are held for election each year on a rotational basis.
- next year, some other seats will be up for election.
- ease the flow of information from one board to the next
- limits the ability of shareholders to replace board members in any one year especially when the shareholders are unhappy with the current board.

### Responsibilities
**Board of directors** is **elected by shareholders** **to act in their best interest**. Board members are typically **mandated by corporate law to be fully informed**, and to use **due diligence and their expertise to fulfil this obligation** to the shareholders. The board of directors is **not involved in the day-to-day management** of the company.

The duties of the board include:
- **Selecting senior management** - e.g. Â planning for continuity of management, and the succession of the CEO or other managers
- **Evaluate management performance** - basis for setting compensation/bonuses
- **Company strategic direction** - making sure that management implements the strategy
- **reviewing company performance** - recommend corrective steps
- **Approve significant acquisitions** and large investments
- **Internal control and risk management system** - establish, monitor, and oversee
- **Financial reporting and audit**

### Board committees
A company's board typically establishes **board committees** that focus on specific functions and provide recommendations to the board on a regular basis.

Some of the board members sit on these committees themselves, according to their area of expertise.

There are different types of committees:
- **Nomination committee** - proposes qualified candidates for elections, manages search process, aligns board's composition with company's corporate governance policies
- **Compensation committee** - evaluate management performance, recommends amounts and types of compensation for directors and senior managers, oversee employee benefit plans, performance evaluation of senior managers
- **Investment committee** - review and reports to the board on management proposals for large acquisitions/projects, sales/disposals of company assets, performance of acquired assets and other large capital expenditures
- **Governance committee** - oversees the company's corporate governance code, implement code of ethics, implement conflict of interest policies, monitors changes in relevant laws/ regulations, ensures compliance with laws/regulations
- **Risk committee** - oversees enterprise wide risk management processes, reports on risk tolerance of the organisation, recommend appropriate risk policy
- **Audit committee** - oversees the financial reporting function and implementation of accounting policies, ensures effectiveness of company's internal controls, ensures effectiveness of internal audit, recommends appointment of external auditor, propose remedies for audit findings, only non-executive or independent directors, which are required by regulation

## Factors affecting stakeholder relationships and corporate governance 
### Market factors
Influential **market factors** for a company include:
- **Shareholder engagement** - mandatory annual general meetings and analyst calls, companies that put in effort to have more communication and contact with shareholders, are likely to have better relations with shareholders
- **Shareholder activism** - strategies by shareholders to create change within the company/modify its behaviour (e.g. proposal for shareholder resolution, raise the issues to other shareholders/public to gain wider support; shareholder derivative lawsuits, which are legal proceedings against the directors, management, and or controlling shareholders of the company) - , hedge funds are among the most predominant shareholder activists.
- **Competitive forces** - can help align managerial interests with those of its shareholders

#### Competitive forces
**Corporate takeover** is the process where the entire board or management is replaced and can be pursued in several different ways:
- **Proxy contest** - shareholders are persuaded to vote for group seeking control
- **Tender offer** - shareholders sell their shares to group seeking control
- **Hostile takeover** - acquire company without management consent; while the board and management can implement anti-takeover measures 
	- staggered board - dilutes the value of shareholder voting rights by eliminating the ability of shareholders to replace the entire board at once
	- shareholder rights plan ("poison pill") - requires shareholders to fork out extra cash to buy additional shares if a takeover group's holding reach a certain threshold

Hostile takeover â€“ acquire company without management consent  
Proxy contest â€“ shareholders are persuaded to vote for group seeking control  
Tender offer â€“ shareholders sell their shares to group seeking control

### Non-market factors
Some of the non-market factors are:
- **Legal environment**
- **The role of the media**
- **Corporate governance industry**

#### Legal environment
When it comes to legal environment, shareholders and creditors interests are considered to be better protected in countries with a **common law system** than in countries with a **civil law system**. Rights of creditors are generally more clearly defined than shareholders rights, therefore shareholder disputes with management are more legally complex.

Where **common law system**:
- able to appeal for judge to rule against management actions that are not expressly forbidden by law
- e.g. UK, US, India, HK

Whereas in **civil law system**:
- generally not possible to convict when an action is not expressly forbidden by law
- e.g. Japan, France, Germany

### The media
**The media** can:
- affect corporate governance
- influence stakeholder relationships
- spread information quickly and shape public opinion.

In the past, corporate boards and managements have had the advantage in using traditional media to influence shareholders or to shape public opinion. However, with advances in communications, especially through internet outlets and social media sites, have levelled the playing fields of dissident shareholders to a significant degree.

When information flows freely, directors and management have more incentive to be transparent and communicate more openly with shareholders.

### Corporate governance industry
The corporate governance industry:
- provides corporate governance services
- advising companies on best practices in corporate governance
- providing investors with ratings of companies' corporate governance practices.

In 2003, the US Securities Exchange and Commission mandated that **US registered mutual funds** disclose their **proxy voting records annually** and to institute procedures to ensure that the proxies they hold for investors in their funds are voted in the best interests of fund investors.
The growth of the industry has helped to promote better corporate governance in firms which are eager to score a better rating from the ratings agencies.

## Risk and benefits of corporate governance
### Risk of poor governance
There are different risks of poor governance:
- **Weak control systems** - include weak audit functions and weak board oversight, the risk is that some stakeholders can gain an advantage, to the disadvantage of other stakeholders.
- **Ineffective decision making** - the risk tolerance level due to management tolerance, but in the expense of shareholder's return
- **Related party transactions** - in the interests of other companies, and unfair terms to the company resulting in bad performance of the company
- **Weaknesses in compliance**
- **Lapses in implementation of regulatory requirements**
- **Legal, regulatory and repetitional risks** - Â may become subject to investigation for violation of applicable laws
- **Default and bankruptcy risk** - the governance risks mentioned above could weaken the financial position of the company, and the company may eventually be unable to meet its debt obligations.

If the creditors choose to take legal action, the company may be declared bankrupt.
The adverse consequences of corporate failures are not limited to the company's creditors and shareholders. Employees, suppliers, managers, and customers, all suffer some form of consequence.

### Benefits of effective governance
There are benefits of effective governance:
- **Improved control and monitoring** - strong audit system, compliance with policies/regulations, reporting violations â‡’ mitigate regulatory/legal risks; adoption of formal procedures with regard to conflicts of interest and related-party transactions, allows the company to ensure fairness in its relationships with parties that it deals with.
- **Better operational efficiency** - clearer understanding of their responsibilities, and reporting lines across the company
- **Better financial performance** - effective governance reduces the costs associated with weak control systems (i.e. poor investments, legal proceedings, excessive management compensations), respond faster to market factors due to improvement of decision-making process
- **Lower default risk and cost of debt** - resulting in better relationship with credit agency, increasingly relevant criteria when a credit rating agency assesses the company's credit worthiness

## Analysis of corporate governance and stakeholder management
A company analysis used to be just of its **fundamentals**, **business model**, and **economic moats**.
However, the importance of **corporate governance** has been increasingly under analysts' attention before investment.

The areas to focus on include:
- **Ownership and voting structures**
- **Board composition**
- **Management remuneration**
- **Composition of shareholders**
- **Strength of shareholder rights**
- **Management of long term risks**

### Ownership and voting structures
There are two types of voting structure:
- **Single class** - voting power is proportional to economic ownership (i.e. 1 vote = 1 share)
- **Dual class** - special class of share where it is not proportional to economic ownership (i.e. >1 vote = 1 share)
	- founding shareholders ("insiders") can maintain control of the board of directors even with less than 50% of shares "Class B" - the lower class "Class A" should be traded at a discount
	- or (i.e. 1 vote = 1 share) but the founding shareholders have rights to elect a majority of the board, whereas the other class "class A" have rights to elect a minority of the board



![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 21.04.06.png]]

### Board composition
The board composition with 3 key areas to be assessed:
- **Expertise** - Do the experience and skill sets on the board match the **current** and **future** needs of the company? It is important for appropriate strategies to overcome unique challenges in the industry.
- **Independence** - Is there any substantial representations of non-executive and independent directors, any involvement in related-party transactions?
- **Tenure** - While directors with long periods of service to a company can offer valuable experience and expertise, there can be a negative effect on the board's diversity and adaptability if the board composition is dominated by such long tenured members.

### Management renumeration
The **remuneration plan** to senior managers is often structured in 3 tiers:
- **Base salary** - paid in cash
- **Short-term bonus** - paid in cash
- **Long-term incentive plan** - paid in equity (e.g. company shares or options to be awarded at future dates)

Very often the short-term and long-term plans are contingent on the company achieving some financial or operational objectives.

**Some of the warning signs** include:
- **Short-term bonus for long-term incentives**
- **Management remuneration is much higher than comparable companies**
- **Past bonuses paid fairly stable over time**
- **Performance targets are not aligned with the company's strategies/objectives**

### Composition of shareholders
The **composition of shareholders** is also an area of concern:
- **Cross-share holdings** - where two companies hold a large minority stake in each other's shares â‡’ support the other party when it comes to voting issues, protecting both companies from potential hostile takeovers and activist shareholders
- **Affiliated shareholder** - can shield company from the effects of voting by outside shareholders. (e.g. company, institution or individuals)
can be as a mean to strengthen between companies and protect company against hostile takeover bids
- **Activist shareholders** - affect significant changes in the composition of a company's shareholders, its board membership, or its corporate strategy, in a short period of time.

### Strength of shareholder rights
shareholders may find it difficult to affect changes to the company's board or corporate strategy if there are:
- anti-takeover provisions
- staggered boards
- class of super-voting shares

### Management of long-term risk
Some long-term risk include:
- negative effect on the operations
- reputation,
- valuation of the company.

## ESG consideration
### Introduction
These are the 3 key themes in measuring the **sustainability** and **ethical impact** of an investment in a company: 
- Environmental
- Social
- Governance

ESG investing generally refers to the consideration of ESG factors when identifying companies to invest in, also broadly known as sustainable investing or socially responsible investing (can also refer to ethical or moral investing (i.e. exclude casino, tobacco, defence companies)). The key is to invest in companies that efficiently manage their **environmental**, **human capital**,
and **financial resources** to generate attractive **long-term profitability**.

Choosing to construct a portfolio **based on ESG factors at the expense of investor returns would technically violate the manager's fiduciary duty**. However, the US Department of Labor has recently addressed this potential conflict, stating that this is not a violation. Specifically, it was determined that when 2 investments have the same relevant financial characteristics, **using ESG factors** to choose one over the other **is not a violation of fiduciary duty**.

### ESG factors
**Environmental factors** that are generally considered material in investment analysis include:
- Natural resource management
- Pollution prevention
- Water conservation
- Energy efficiency
- The existence of carbon assets
- Adherence to environmental safety
- Regulatory standards

**Social factors** are the management of the human capital of a business, which include:
- Human rights and welfare concerns in the workplace
- Staff development
- Employee diversity
- Impact of the business on the community.

These factors can affect the firm's staff turnover, employee morale, and reputation.

There's no universal set of factors that can be applied to all companies, as the materiality of these ESG factors often differs among sectors.

### ESG implementation approaches
There are several implementation approaches:
- **Negative screening** - exclusionary screening
- **Positive screening** - identify companies that have positive ESG practices
- **Best-in-class approach** - identify companies within each industry group with the best ESG practices. No particular industry is excluded
- **ESG integration** - ESG factors are integrated into traditional security and industry analysis
- **Thematic investing** - investing in a specific sector or a specific theme based on needs arising from economic or social trends
- **Impact investing** - achieve targeted social or environmental objectives, along with measurable financial returns

One approach is through **negative screening**, which is also called **exclusionary screening**.
e.g. some specific mining, oil extraction, transport, and tobacco may be excluded due to poor track records on corruption and human rights practices.

Many of these negative screens use specific standards such as the UN Global Compact's 10 principles on human rights, labor, the environment, and corruption to identify the companies that should be excluded.

In contrast, the **positive screening** approach is to identify companies that have positive ESG practices. It's typically implemented through an ESG ranking or scoring approach to identify companies that can successfully manage ESG risks and may benefit from ESG-related opportunities in their sector.

The **best-in-class approach**, seeks to identify companies within each industry group with the best ESG practices. Such an approach does not exclude any industry, but instead focuses on finding the best representation within each sector. This **allows portfolio managers to maintain sector weightings** comparable to a benchmark index. This helps reduce the risk of overweighting or underweighting certain sectors due to ESG considerations.

Another approach is called **ESG integration** or ESG incorporation. ESG factors are integrated into traditional security and industry analysis. To identify risks and opportunities arising from ESG factors, and to determine whether a company is properly managing its ESG resources in a sustainable manner.

**Thematic investing** focuses on investing in a specific sector or a specific theme. This approach is often based on needs arising from economic or social trends. 
e.g., **sustainable energy sources** is an ESG theme that arose from the demand for clean energy as the world becomes more sensitive to climate change. **Clean water resources** is another such theme that arose from rising global living standards and industrial need for clean water.

**Impact investing** seeks to achieve targeted social or environmental objectives along with measurable financial returns. 
e.g. specific companies or projects, including venture capital investments in companies focused on increasing sustainability or providing environmental improvements.
e.g2. purchase of climate bonds (green bonds) by investors who want to advance low carbon initiatives, issued to finance projects that seek to fight climate change, such as the development of infrastructure and alternative energy projects.
