## Approaches to calculate GDP
**Gross domestic products (GDP)** is the total market value of the goods and services produced in an economy within a certain period of time.

Before diving into calculation of GDP, there are some definitions that must be defined.
**Aggregate output** is the total market value of all the goods and services produced in a specified period of time. **Aggregate income** is value of all the payments earned by suppliers of factors used in the production of goods and services. Since the value of goods/services â‡’ suppliers of factors. **Aggregate expenditure** is the total amount spent on the goods/services produced in the domestic economy. 

In single isolated economy, aggregate output = aggregate expenditure = aggregate income.

Therefore, there are different approach to calculate the GDP, namely the **expenditure approach** and the **income approach**. The measurement issues can result in different values but in theory all of the GDP level should be the same.

**Expenditure approach** is calculating the GDP through total amount spent on goods/services produced within a period.

**Income approach** is calculating the GDP through the amount earned by household and companies in the economy.

### Criteria for inclusion in GDP calculation
There are 3 criteria for including in the GDP calculation:
- **Measurement period** - all goods/services included in the calculation must be produced during the measurement period (normally it is 1 calendar year with annualised quarterly estimates)
- **Market value** - value of good/service can be determined by being sold in the market (excluding non-market activities, illegal activities, transfer payments (i.e. unemployment welfare benefits))
- **Final goods/services** - only the market value of **final** goods and services should be included â‡’ exclude intermediate goods (this method is termed as value-of-final-output method); the other method is sum-of-value-method, which is to sum up all the value added during production and distribution processes; both methods should have the same value

## Nominal vs real GDP
**Nominal GDP** is the GDP based on current market value. The nominal GDP includes the effect of price increase (inflation) â‡’ not representative of actual production growth.
The nominal GDP equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Nominal\,GDP_t=\sum{P_t}Q_t}$$
which P: Price; Q: Quantity. The equation represent the nominal GDP of a specific time period is the sum of all the current prices multiply by the quantity produced for each good.

**Real GDP** is the GDP based on base year market value. The real GDP is commonly used as it only reflects the GDP growth of the total output.
The real GDP equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Real\,GDP_t=\sum{P_base}Q_t}$$
which P: Price; Q: Quantity. Since the price inflation effect have been removed by using the price of base year, the real GDP change indicates real actual production output increase/decrease.

The per-capita real GDP is used to measure the resident's economic well-being.
The Per-capita Real GDP equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Per\,capita\,Real\,GDP=\frac{Real\,GDP}{Population}}$$

## GDP deflator
**GDP deflator** is used to convert nominal GDP to real GDP. 

The GDP deflator equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{GDP\,Deflator_t=\frac{Nominal\,GDP_t}{Real\,GDP_t}\times100}$$
and it can also be rearranged to calculate real GDP if GDP deflator value is known.
$$\mathrm{Real\,GDP_t=\frac{Nominal\,GDP_t}{GDP\,Deflator_t}\times100}$$

## Economic flows
Most modern economies will also have a government sector which can be a major player in the economy and the foreign sector, which comprises transactions with the rest of the world.

In such an economy, the activity center primarily around:
- **the factors of production market**  - labour, land, capital, and in turn business payout national income to households
- **the goods and services market** - consumption from households, investment from businesses (inflow and outflow of goods/service market), government spending (G, inflow to the g/s market: outflow to business from government spending), imports and exports (M and X) with foreign countries
- **the financial markets** - household savings ($S_h$), business financing (debt/equity), business savings($S_b$), if government spending > taxes, government has to borrow from the financial market,  imports and exports (M and X), if M > X, trade deficit â‡’ net foreign borrowing; if M < X â‡’ net foreign lending through financial market

## Major components of GDP
The GDP calculation through **expenditure method** is the total expenditures is the aggregate of household spendings (C), Investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (X-M). Normally, the expenditure method is used since it is more timely and reliable than the income components.

The **expenditure approach** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)}$$
where C: consumption; I: investment; G: government spending; X: exports; M: imports.

The **income approach** of calculating GDP is measured the national income, with capital consumption allowance and statistical discrepancy. 

The **income approach** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{GDP = National\,income+CCA+statistical\,discrepancy}$$
where CCA: capital consumption allowance.

### Income approach
The income approach is breaking down into national income, capital consumption allowance (CCA), and statistical discrepancy.

#### National income
The **national income** is the sum of income received by all factors of production, includes:
- employee compensation
- interest income
- business owner income
- rent
- corporate/government enterprise profits (pre-tax)
- indirect business taxes (less subsidies) (e.g. sales tax, import duties, property tax)

National income can also break down into personal income and saving personal income as a measure of the pre-tax income received by households and is one determinant of consumer purchasing power and consumption.

Of the components of **national income,** **employee compensation**, **interest income**, **business owner income** and **rent** can be considered personal income, and only the distributed corporate profits from distribution to shareholders (i.e. dividends) can be considered as personal income.

Governments also make **transfer payments** in the form of payouts like unemployment benefits or indirectly through programs like universal health care. It is also considered as personal income. **Transfer payments are not included in government expenditures**. **Transfer payments** are subtracted from taxes and reflected in net taxes.

From national income, personal income is the national income deduct undistributed corporate profits, deduct corporate income taxes deduct indirect business taxes + transfer payments.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 15.29.53.png]]

**Personal disposable income** is the personal income minus personal income tax. It indicates the amount household have available to spend/save. It is an economic indicator of consumers' ability to spend and save.

The **personal disposable income** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{PDI = Personal\,income-Personal\,income\,tax}$$
where PDI: personal disposable income.

#### Capital consumption allowance (CCA)
**Capital consumption allowance (CCA)** is the profit reinvested to maintain physical capital, it measures the wear and tear of physical capital.

#### Statistical discrepancy 
**Statistical discrepancy** is the adjustment for the difference between GDP measured under two approaches (i.e. income and expenditure approach) since the data collected through two approaches are different.

## Fundamental relationship
There are some fundamental relationship between:
- **Savings/ Investment**
- **Fiscal balance (G-T)**; government spending and taxes
- **Trade balance (X-M)**; exports and imports

There are several alternative expression of GDP:
$$\mathrm{GDP=National\,income+S_b}$$
where $S_b$ is business savings.
$$\mathrm{GDP=T+C+S_h+S_b}$$
where T: net taxes, C: consumption; $S_h$ is household savings; $S_b$ is business savings.
$$\mathrm{GDP=T+C+S}$$
where T: net taxes, C: consumption; $S$ is total household and business savings.

If we equate the two GDP calculation together, we can find out the relationship of savings with investment, fiscal balance, and trade balance.

The relationship is as follows:
$$\mathrm{S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)}$$
where S: domestic private savings, G: Government spending; T: net taxes: (G-T) is fiscal balance; X: export; M: imports.

This equation demonstrates that **domestic private savings** is used or absorbed in 3 ways:
- **Investment spending**
- **Finance government deficits**
- **Financial claims against other countries** **(trade surplus)** or **domestic savings supplemented by inflows of foreign saving** **(trade deficit)**

Again rearranging the equation:
$$\mathrm{(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)}$$
where government deficit/ fiscal balance has to be financed through excess private savings over private investment and trade deficit.

## Aggregate demand and supply
**Aggregate demand of economy** is the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real output (i.e. real income). In order to come to this aggregate demand curve, there are two curves that contribute to aggregate demand: IS curve and LM curve.

### IS curve of aggregate demand
**Investment-savings (IS) curve** derives from the equation:
$$\mathrm{(S-I)=(G-T)+(X-M)}$$
where (G-T) is fiscal deficit and (X-M) is trade surplus. The investment-savings curve affects the goods market equilibrium. The **goods market equilibrium** has to be maintained. The affecting factors are the **real interest rate** and **real income**. Therefore, in consideration of the goods market, there needs to be an **inverse relationship between real interest rates and real income** to maintain **goods market equilibrium**. Since that's the case, the **IS curve is downward sloping**.
![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.23.52.png | 300]]

### LM curve of aggregate demand
**Liquidity-money (LM) curve** demonstrates the **money market equilibrium** through the **real interest rate** and **real income**. To maintain money market equilibrium, the demand for money should be equal to the supply of money. Therefore, in consideration of the money market, there has to be a **direct relationship between real interest rates and real income** to maintain **money market equilibrium**.

To put it simply, â†‘ real interest rates â†“ the demand for money because investors are encouraged to shift their assets out of money into higher yielding securities to maintain the real money supply at a given level, equilibrium in the money market requires that the income level be increased, such that the demand is kept constant as well. Since that's the case, **LM curve is upward sloping**. 

The **equation of exchange is MV = PY**. If velocity (V) is increasing faster than real output (Y), inflation (P) would have to be increasing faster than the money supply (M) to keep the equation in balance.

The **quantity theory** focuses on the quantity of money. The quantity theory states that velocity is not affected by monetary policy. Increasing banks' excess reserves would most likely lead to higher inflation.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.24.19.png | 300]]

The **LM curve is drawn by a given M/P**; where M is constant nominal money supply and P is price level. â†‘ in price shifts the curve upwards, â†“ in price resulting in higher M/P, shifting the curve downwards.

### IS curve and LM curve equilibrium and aggregate demand
When the IS and LM curves are combined, the point at which they intersect **represents the levels of the real interest rate and income that are consistent with equilibrium in the goods market and equilibrium in the money market**. This is how the **aggregate demand curve** of an economy is derived.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.28.39.png | 300]]

### Downward sloping aggregate demand curve
The aggregate demand curve slopes downward since:
At higher price levels:
- â†“ real wealth
- â†‘ real interest rates
- domestically goods more expensive
all of which â†“ quantity of demand of domestic goods.

At lower price levels:
- â†‘ real wealth
-  â†“ real interest rates
- domestically goods are cheaper
all of which â†‘ quantity of demand of domestic goods.

### Aggregate supply
**Aggregate supply** is the amount of output that all the domestic producers are willing to provide at various prices. Unlike the demand side, we must distinguish between the **very short, short and long run aggregate supply curves**.

The main reason for the differences is due to the assumption regarding how input prices like **wages**, **material costs** and **rent** respond to **changes in production levels**.

#### Very short-run aggregate supply
In the **very short-run aggregate supply**, the companies can vary output without changing prices. As such, companies can increase or decrease output to some degree without changing price, resulting in a perfectly elastic supply curve.

Manufacturers can increase production in response to very short term spikes in orders by increasing overtime hours, maximizing the existing plant and equipment and by depleting its existing stockpile of components. All these can be done without increasing the unit cost of each unit produced.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.35.23.png]]

#### Short-run aggregate supply
In **short-run aggregate supply**, the assumption is that only some input prices will change as production is increased or decreased as some input prices can be slow to adjust. Therefore SRAS results in an upward sloping aggregate supply curve. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.37.42.png]]

#### Long-run aggregate supply
In the **long run**, all input prices tend to catch up with the level of their demand. In other words, wages and other input prices that are slow to adjust in the short run. However, it will adjust to the changes in that demand in the long run resulting in a perfectly inelastic supply curve. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 16.39.39.png]]

## Shift in aggregate demand
There is an **aggregate demand shift**, when the factors changed to increase the demand and shift the demand curve from left to right.

It has been categorised through different stakeholders:
- **Household (Consumption; C)** - consumer wealth, expectation of future income, fiscal policy
- **Business (Investment; I)** - business outlook, capacity utilisation, monetary policy, fiscal policy
- **Government (Government spending; G)** - fiscal policy
- **Trade (Exports and imports; X-M)** - currency strength, global growth

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 00.31.41.png]]

## Shift in long-run aggregate supply
The **long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)** is perfectly inelastic. Therefore, in order to increase the economy in the long run, the growth in economy's **resource base** increases potential GDP. 

The resource base includes:
- Supply of labour - also supply of human capital through training/education; advanced  technology â†‘ and efficient human labour
- Supply of natural resources
- Supply of physical capital (PP&E)

With the shift in LRAS, it will also shift the SRAS towards the right.

## Shift in short-run aggregate supply
The **short-run aggregate supply** is affected mostly by the expectations of future output price and cost of production. 

There are some of the factors which lowers the cost of production :
- **Input price (nominal wages, rent, materials)** â†“ â‡’ firms can produce more at a profit
- **Currency strength (import raw materials)** â†‘ â‡’ domestic firms import foreign goods at cheaper prices
- **Business taxes** â†“
- **Subsidies** â†‘

Also, if businesses **expect that the future output price â†‘**, in the short-run, businesses will expand production in anticipation of higher prices.

#### Summary of shift in SRAS and LRAS
![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 00.50.22.png]]

## Macroeconomic equilibrium
The macroeconomic equilibrium is determined by the intersection point of **aggregate demand (AD)**, **long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)** and **short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)**.

The **aggregate demand** is affected by:
- Consumption (C)
- Investment (I)
- Government spending (G)
- Trade (X-M)

The **LRAS** is the **potential GDP at full employment and physical capital at 100% utilisation** , which are all the factors that â†‘ resources capacity/ productivity.

The **SRAS** are influenced by short term â†“ cost of production and the perception of improved pricing power. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 00.52.20.png]]

In the short run,  
Stagflation: GDPâ†“, Priceâ†‘  
Inflationary gap: GDPâ†‘, Priceâ†‘  
Recessionary gap: GDPâ†“, Priceâ†“



## Economic growth and sustainability 
### Sources of economic growth
There are 5 sources of economic growth:
- **Labour supply** - over age of 16, employed/looking for work, labour force participation rate, can be increased through immigration and population growth
- **Physical capital stock** - Plant/equipment to produce goods and services
- **Human capital** - education/skill level of labour force, import foreign talent, increase productivity, harness technology
- **Technology** - overcome limits of diminishing marginal returns (i.e. skilled workforce + advanced equipment (R&D expenditure) = â†‘ productivity)
- **Natural resources** - renewable (e.g. forests), non-renewable (e.g. oil)
and some may consider 4 sources as natural resources is not a determinant factor for economic growth.

The equation for **production function**:
$$\mathrm{Y=A \times f(L,K)}$$
where Y: aggregate output (GDP); A: total factor productivity (proxy for technology); f: the human capital, labour supply and physical capital stock; L: size of labour force, K: amount of capital

The production function can also be stated in a **per worker basis**:
$$\mathrm{\frac{Y}{L}=A \times f(\frac{K}{L})}$$
The output per worker, which is a measurement of **labour productivity**, is a function of total factor productivity multiply by the physical capital per worker. This equation suggest to improve labour productivity, it can either be through **improvement of technology** or **physical capital per worker**.

The **potential GDP calculation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Potential\,GDP=Size \,of\,labour\,force \times Labour\,productivity\,(per\,worker)}$$
Economist often investigate on the **labour productivity** as it is a good measure of the health/prosperity of the economy and thus the increase in potential GDP with the same number of workers.

Another way of **potential GDP calculation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Potential\,GDP=Aggregate\,hours\,worked \times Labour\,productivity\,(per\,hour)}$$

In terms of potential GDP growth, the equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Potential\,GDP=Growth\,labour\,force +Growth\, in\, labour\,productivity}$$

Therefore, the long-term potential GDP growth rate can be estimated through labour force growth rate and labour productivity growth rate:
**In terms of potential GDP growth**, the equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Sustainable\,growth\,rate=Labour\,force\,growth\,rate +Labour\,productivity\,growth\,rate}$$
The **long-term sustainable growth rate** is importance since the long-term equity returns are highly dependent on economic growth over time.

The other way of calculating  potential GDP growth through **Solow model/neoclassical model** is:
$$\mathrm{Potential\,GDP\,growth=Tech\,growth +W_L(Labour\,growth)+W_C(Capital\,growth)}$$
where the $W_L$: labour percentage share of national income; $W_C$: capital percentage share of national income and they should add up to 1. The assumption is contribution to long-term growth depends on share of national income. For developed economies, $W_L$ > $W_C$; for investments in physical capital is less effective. The change in total factor productivity, this is the growth in potential GDP not explained through growth in labour and growth in capital.

The potential GDP growth can be calculated per capita basis:
$$\mathrm{Potential\,GDP\,per\,capita growth=Tech\,growth +W_C(Capital\,to\,labour\,growth)}$$
e.g. $W_C$  = 0.3 indicates â†‘ 1% capital per worker will â†‘ 0.3% GDP per worker. There is a diminishing marginal productivity in developed economy. Policymakers can't keep growing the economy through capital deepening investments, however, for developed economy, growth in technology should be the primary source of growth in GDP per worker.
