## Characteristics of market structure
### Overview and definition
Market structure is a spectrum with 4 main categories:
- **Perfect competition** - which many firms produce identical products and competition forces them all to sell at the market price.
- **Monopolistic competition** - where there are many sellers and differentiated products
- **Oligopoly** - where a few firms compete in a variety of ways
- **Monopoly** - where only one firm is producing the product.

Where an industry falls along this spectrum can be determined by examining 5 characteristics of the industry, which are:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes**
- **Barriers to entry/exit**
- **Product differentiation**
- **Nature of competition**
- **Pricing power**

### Perfect competition
**Perfect competition** refers to a market in which many firms produce identical products, has perfectly elastic demand curve:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Many firms
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - Very low
- **Product differentiation** - Identical products
- **Nature of competition** - Compete on price only
- **Pricing power** - None

Perfect competition is just in theory, though, some industries come close to it. The wheat production industry in a region is a good approximation where there is hardly any differences in the products, tend to price according to market supply and demand.

### Monopolistic competition
**Monopolistic competition** also has many competing firms, but differs from perfect competition in that the products are differentiated and has a elastic demand curve:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Many firms
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - Very low
- **Product differentiation** - Differentiated in quality, features, marketing
- **Nature of competition** - Price and product differentiation
- **Pricing power** - Limited; perceived differences among competing products.

e.g. shampoo industry, differentiate through features and marketing with claims like more attractive hair, anti dandruff and anti hair loss features. Such features can have perceived value in some consumers, the shampoo manufacturers are able to price according to the demand for their products.

### Oligopoly
**Oligopoly market** has limited competing firms, the products are differentiated but consider strategies of other firms to set the price and product differentiation, and has a elastic demand curve (but can vary inelasticity; very differentiated products tend to have more elastic demand than firms with less differentiation):
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Few firms
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - High (economies of scale)
- **Product differentiation** - Very good substitutes or differentiated (through features marketing, branding, quality)
- **Nature of competition** - Price and product differentiation (unique characteristic of an oligopoly is that each firm must consider the strategies and actions of other firms in setting its own price and differentiation strategy - i.e. interdependent firm)
- **Pricing power** - Limited; perceived differences among competing products.

e.g. The telco industry is a good example of an oligopoly with less differentiated firms. The basic services that they provide are quite similar, so they have limited pricing power.

On the other hand, the automobile market is an oligopoly in which the firms differentiate themselves on features, quality, branding and marketing, such carmakers have significant pricing power, resulting in more inelastic demand and greater variance in car prices.

### Monopoly
**Monopoly market** is characterised by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes, thereby little competition, and the market demand curve is downward sloping, might be regulated by the government, so there is a regulated price:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Single seller
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - Very high
- **Product differentiation** - No close substitutes
- **Nature of competition** - Little competition
- **Pricing power** - Significant

There are several reasons for monopoly:
- **Very high barriers to entry** - protect a monopoly producer from competition.
- **Copyrights and patents** - protect a monopoly from competition.
- **Control over key resource** - specifically needed to produce the product.
- **Government support**

e.g. The most common example of a regulated monopoly is the local electrical power provider. In most cases, the monopoly power provider is allowed to earn a normal return on its investment and prices are set by the regulatory authority to allow that return.

## Definitions of terms in economics
### Market demand & supply vs. Firm's demand & supply
Whenever you study demand or supply curves, be very clear, whether the curves representing the market or of the firm, the two can look similar, but there are important differences.

### Economic costs and profits
**Economic costs** and **economic profits** differ from accounting costs and profits in a significant way.

**Economic costs** are based on **opportunity cost**, which is measured by determining a resource is next best opportunity.
e.g. the farmer's land could have been leased out instead of growing wheat and earned a normal return on it, so the return foregone by not doing so is an opportunity cost.

In economic terms, the **total economic cost** includes the full **normal market return** on all the resources utilised in the business.

If a firm does not earn economic profit, it doesn't mean that the firm makes no profit at all (i.e. 0 economic profit $\ne$ 0 accounting profit). Rather, it means that the firm is just making normal profit based on its opportunity costs. **Normal profit = Zero economic profit**.


## Perfect competition
### Market demand and firm's demand & supply

The **market demand** of a **perfectly competitive market is usually downward sloping,** consumers as a whole demand less when market prices high and more when market price is low (i.e. â†‘ price â†“ demand; â†“ price â†‘ demand). On the other hand, the **overall supply curve** of the market is **upward sloping**, the higher the market price, the more the producers want to supply and vice versa (i.e. â†‘ price â†‘ supply; â†“ price â†“ supply). If we get the intersection where demand equals supply, we get the **market price**.

As price takers, **firms demand curve** in a perfectly competitive market face a **perfectly elastic demand curve** at the **market price**. This implies that every additional unit that the firm produces and sell at the same price, meaning that the marginal revenue (MR) curve is also horizontal at this level and since every unit is sold at the same price, the average revenue (AR) curve is also this same line  (i.e. **firm demand market price = MR = AR**).

In a perfectly competitive market, products are identical so firms typically compete on price only. 

**Donâ€™t confuse market demand curve with firm demand curve**. Market demand curve is downward sloping.  
Firm demand curve is horizontal (perfectly elastic).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.00.40.png]]

### Marginal cost curve of the firm
Marginal cost (MC) curve for a firm is generally upward sloping due to decreasing marginal productivity, the cost of reducing every additional unit increases. To maximize profit, the firm expand production until marginal revenue equals marginal cost (i.e. MR=MC).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.00.57.png]]

### Economic profit situation
Let the profit maximising level of production as Q*. The average total cost (ATC) of a firm is upward sloping where its minimum is intersected by the marginal cost (MC) curve.

The profit per unit is the average revenue (AR) minus the average total cost (ATC). 
The average profit equation (when MR>MC) is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,profit=Average\,revenue-Average\,total\,cost}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.02.10.png]]

### In the short run of economic loss situation
If the market demand and supply situation is poor, the market price drops. If market prices so low that the average revenue can't cover the average total cost (i.e. AR < ATC), the firm runs at an economic loss. However, if this point is still above the average variable cost (i.e. AR > AVC), the firm should continue operating in the short run as it can help lessen the losses due to the fixed costs.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.02.20.png]]

### In the long run of economic loss situation
Under economic theory, **neither economic profit nor economic loss is sustainable in the long run in a perfectly competitive market**. If existing firms are making economic loss in the short run, some of them will **eventually shut down or reduce scale**, thus **reducing supply**, **driving prices up and eliminating any economic losses**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.03.42.png]]


### In the long run of economic profit situation
Conversely, if there are economic profits to be made, new firms will enter the industry in the long run, **increasing supply**, **drive the market price down**, **eliminating any economic profit**. In essence, market price will converge to this level in the long run, where no economic profit or loss is expected.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.03.51.png]]

### Long-run equilibrium output level
The **long equilibrium output level** is the level where the **average total cost (ATC) is at its minimum** and Q* is the corresponding long run equilibrium output level or perfectly competitive firms.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.04.00.png]]

### Firm supply curve
Below this price level of AVC, the firm should shut down both in the short run and long
run, so business wouldn't want to make any production when the price is below this level. Above this level, the production can actually help to minimise losses from fixed costs, so business would want to start supplying the market from this point onwards. Therefore, business should start the **firm supply curve should be MC (i.e. S=MC) above the AVC minima**. As the market price increases, the more you would want to supply the market according to your marginal cost (MC).

### Market supply curve
For the market, none of the firms will want to produce anything below this price point, so output is 0. The short run market supply curve slopes upwards as the price increases, firms want to supply more. Now that we have a better grasp of both the supply and demand curves for the market and for the firm, let's examine the effects of a permanent increase in demand for a product.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.18.33.png]]

### Effects of a permanent increase in market demand
When there is an increase in demand, the long run market demand curve shifts upwards and to the right. This results in a corresponding increase in the market price at this new price point. **All firms will earn an economic profit**. Positive economic profits will cause new firms to enter the market as these **new firms increase total industry supply**, the **industry supply curve will gradually shift downwards and to the right** and the **market price will decline back to the original level**.

**Short run**: Price â†‘, Firms make economic profits
**Long run**: Price converges back to equilibrium due to more competitors, no economic profits

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.19.40.png]]

### Effects of a permanent decrease in market demand
In the short run, the **market demand curve shifts left and downwards**, resulting in a **decrease in market price**. Firms make **economic loss** in the short term. In the long run, some firms s**hut down or reduced scale**, resulting in a **reduction in market supply**. **Market supply curve shifts left and up**, bring the market price back to the equilibrium level. So, again, there's **no change in market price in the long run**. The only thing that has changed is that **the overall supply has been reduced**.

**Short run**: Price â†“, Firms make economic loss
**Long run**: Price converges back to equilibrium due to less competitors, no economic profits

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 18.20.01.png]]


## Monopolistic competition
**Monopolistic competition** also has many competing firms, but differs from perfect competition in that the products are differentiated and has a elastic demand curve:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Many firms independent sellers
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - Very low (i.e. free to enter/exit the market)
- **Product differentiation** - Differentiated in quality, features, marketing (products are slightly different from each other, close substitutes as basic functions are the same)
- **Nature of competition** - Price and product differentiation
- **Pricing power** - Limited; perceived differences among competing products (i.e. price fixing is almost impossible)

e.g. shampoo industry, differentiate through features and marketing with claims like more attractive hair, anti dandruff and anti hair loss features. Such features can have perceived value in some consumers, the shampoo manufacturers are able to price according to the demand for their products.

Although the demand curves for most firms are **highly elastic because competing products are close substitutes, firms can make their demand curves less elastic** by providing compelling quality and features that **consumers are willing to pay a premium for**. Marketing is a must to inform the market about such differentiating characteristics.


![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 21.18.26.png]]

### Short run equilibrium of monopolistic competition
The demand curve is also the **average revenue (AR)** curve, but **it's not the marginal revenue (MR) curve**. For downward sloping AR curve, the **MR curve is also downward sloping, but below and steeper than the AR curve**.

The **profit maximising level of output is where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost (i.e. MR=MC)**, **which is at the quantity level of Q*.** At this Q*, and at this level of production, the average total cost is lower than the price in this case (i.e. average profit = AR - ATC). The firm earns economic profits in the short run.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 21.18.58.png]]

### Long run equilibrium of monopolistic competition
Since there is an economic profit and the barriers to entry are so low in monopolistic competition, new firms will enter. When the **competition and choices for the buyers increase**, the **demand for each firm's products decreases**, shifting the demand curve down to the point where price equals average total cost such that economic profit equals zero (i.e. P* = ATC), where there will be no more economic profit. At this point, there's no longer an incentive for new firms to enter the market and **long run equilibrium is established**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 21.19.07.png]]

### Comparison between monopolistic competition and perfect competition
The obvious differences between monopolistic competition and perfect competition are:
- In **monopolistic competition**, **sells at a higher price, higher average total cost and a lower quantity than under perfect competition** - firm may not be  producing at the most efficient level
- In **monopolistic competition**, the **economic cost in includes product differentiation costs** (e.g. marketing costs and R&D)
- In **perfect competition**, there are **little costs associated with marketing or R&D because all products are homogenous**.
- In **perfect competition** - **prices are lower, but consumers may have little variety**


![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 21.19.20.png]]

## Oligopoly
**Oligopoly market** has limited competing firms, the products are differentiated but consider strategies of other firms to set the price and product differentiation, and has a elastic demand curve (but can vary inelasticity; very differentiated products tend to have more elastic demand than firms with less differentiation):
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Few firms
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - High (economies of scale)
- **Product differentiation** - Very good substitutes or differentiated (through features marketing, branding, quality)
- **Nature of competition** - Price and product differentiation (unique characteristic of an oligopoly is that each firm must consider the strategies and actions of other firms in setting its own price and differentiation strategy - i.e. interdependent firm)
- **Pricing power** - Limited; perceived differences among competing products.

e.g. The telco industry is a good example of an oligopoly with less differentiated firms. The basic services that they provide are quite similar, so they have limited pricing power.

On the other hand, the automobile market is an oligopoly in which the firms differentiate themselves on features, quality, branding and marketing, such carmakers have significant pricing power, resulting in more inelastic demand and greater variance in car prices.

Oligopoly markets are hard to generalise as the characteristics of the firms and the markets can be vastly different.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 16.55.24.png]]

Since the price of the **oligopoly market** is interdependent, there are 4 major models follow by the model's assumption and shortcomings:
- **Kinked demand curve** - In essence, the demand curve can intuitively explain why the market price is stable at its current level in most oligopoly markets. (i.e. **assumptions**: increase in price will not be followed by competitors; Decrease in price will be followed by competitors) **shortcoming**: unable to explain what determines the market prevailing price.
- **Cournot model** - two competing firms know the quantity supplied by each other in the previous period, and both firms make decisions assuming that the other's supply will not change the next period
- **Nash equilibrium** - all firms will make choices where there is a chance of a better outcome, until there is no other choice that makes any firm better off
- **Dominant firm** - one firm has a significantly large market share so it determines the market price

The important point of oligopoly markets is that the firm's decisions are interdependent so that the expected reaction of other firms is an important consideration. Overall, given the market demand curve, the market maximises profits when the market marginal revenue is equal to the market marginal cost (i.e. MC = MR). The market price will be at this level if there is perfect collusion amongst the firms (i.e. $\mathrm{P_{Collusion}}$; $\mathrm{Q_{Collusion}}$). In reality, it's somewhere between this level and the price level that would result from perfect competition ($\mathrm{P_{compeition}}$; $\mathrm{Q_{competition}}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.57.44.png]]

### Kinked demand curve
In the **kinked demand curve**, there are **several assumptions**:
- **Increase in price will not be followed by competitors** - as firms believe that they can benefit from switching over; demand curve that is more elastic above the prevailing price.
- **Decrease in price will be followed by competitors** - if a firm lowers its price, other will likely follow suit to prevent their customers (i.e. less elastic demand curve)

Therefore, under this model, a firm in an oligopoly market has more to lose when it raise prices and has less to gain when it lowers prices. As such, the **most profitable price point**, an output combination for the firm, is at the **kink**. A firm, an oligopoly market will maintain its price at this level unless a competitor lowers its price.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.01.36.png]]

It's interesting to note that due to the shape of a kinked demand curve, the corresponding marginal revenue (MR) curve of the firm will have a gap as shown. The **profit maximising quantity** for a firm is where the **marginal revenue equal the marginal cost** (i.e. MR=MC).
If the marginal cost curve of the firm passes through this gap, the firm produces at the most profitable price and output combination, so that isn't a problem.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.03.35.png]]

However, if the marginal cost curve for the firm rises above such that it has to raise its price, it is a problem for the firm as demand is inelastic for price points higher than the prevailing price. It may lose a lot of customers if the competitors do not raise their prices.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.08.58.png]]

### Cournot model
Another model of oligopoly pricing and output is the **Cournot model**, the model have 4 assumptions 
- an oligopoly with only two firms competing (duopoly)
- both have **identical and constant marginal costs of production** (i.e. identical and constant MC).
- each firm knows quantity supplied by other firm in previous period
- assumes that the other firm's supply will not change in the next period

The **Cournot equilibrium** which assumes a **duopoly** falls **between a monopoly solution
and perfectly competitive equilibrium**. It can be shown that as the **number of firms increases**, the **output and price equilibrium positions move toward the competitive equilibrium**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.13.58.png]]

### Nash equilibrium
The third model is the **Nash equilibrium** model developed by Nobel Prize winner John Nash, the Nash equilibrium assumes:
- All firms will make choices where there is a chance of a better outcome for the firm (i.e. Nash equilibrium is reached when the choices of all firms are such that there's no other choice that makes any firm better off.)

The Nash equilibrium explains that the collusive agreement can help oligopolistic firms to increase in everyone's profit, tend to be more successful when:
- Fewer firms
- Products are less diversified
- Purchases are relatively small and frequent
- Retaliation by other firms for cheating is more certain and more severe
- Less competition from firms outside the cartel
Nash concludes collusive agreements to increase profits are seldom successful if there are no binding agreements.

#### Prisoner's dilemma
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classical game theory. Two prisoners A and B are believed to have committed a serious crime. However, the prosecutor does not have sufficient evidence for a conviction, so the prisoners are separated and offered the following deal.

Since they are separated, neither knows what the other will do, even though they've colluded beforehand that they'll both remain silent. According to Nash, both prisoners are likely to break their collusion and confess this is because the outcome where both are silent is not an equilibrium prisoner.
![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.23.04.png]]

So likewise for an oligopoly with two firms. Both firms could collude beforehand to increase prices so both earn higher profits. However, if there are no binding agreements, both firms will choose to cheat as they could potentially earn more. There is no guarantee that the other party will honour the collusion. The Nash equilibrium is therefore for both firms to cheat, so according to Nash, collusive agreements to increase profits are seldom successful if there are no binding agreements.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.23.42.png]]

#### Cartel and Nash equilibrium
When collusive agreements are made openly and formally, the firms involved are called a cartel. The OPEC oil cartel is an example of such a collusive agreement that evidence is common that cartel members regularly cheat on their agreements to share the optimal output of oil.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.25.07.png]]

### Dominant firm
Another oligopoly firm model is the **dominant firm model**, in this model it assumes:
- One single firm (**dominant firm**) that has a significantly large market share because of its greater scale and lower cost structure.
- Dominant firm determines the market price
- Rest of the firms are just price takers (followers)

Given the market demand curve, we can estimate the demand curve of the dominant firm, the dominant firm believes that the quantity supplied by the other firms decreases at lower prices. The dominant firms demand curve is closer to the market demand curve when the price is low.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.43.57.png]]

#### Dominant firm optimise price points
Based on this demand curve and its associated marginal revenue curve, the firm will maximize profits at the production level ($\mathrm{Q_{DF}}$) where its marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost (i.e. $\mathrm{MR_{DF}}$ = $\mathrm{MC_{DF}}$). The market price set by the dominant firm is therefore P*.

#### Followers optimise price points
As for the price followers, their marginal cost (MC) curves are likely higher than that of the dominant firm, which probably obtained its dominant position due to its lower cost structure. The price followers maximize profits by producing the quantity for which their marginal cost equals P* (i.e. MC = P*; which is determined by the dominant firm). They seldom attempt to undercut the dominant firm as it's futile to compete based on price, as the dominant firm has a cheaper cost structure.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 17.44.11.png]]

## Monopoly
**Monopoly market** is characterised by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes, thereby little competition, and the market demand curve is downward sloping, might be regulated by the government, so there is a regulated price:
- **Number of sellers and their relative sizes** - Single seller
- **Barriers to entry/exit** - Very high
- **Product differentiation** - No close substitutes
- **Nature of competition** - Little competition
- **Pricing power** - Significant

There are several reasons for monopoly:
- **Very high barriers to entry** - protect a monopoly producer from competition.
- **Copyrights and patents** - protect a monopoly from competition.
- **Control over key resource** - specifically needed to produce the product.
- **Government support** - known as natural monopoly

e.g. The most common example of a regulated monopoly is the local electrical power provider. In most cases, the monopoly power provider is allowed to earn a normal return on its investment and prices are set by the regulatory authority to allow that return.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 18.01.22.png]]

### Pricing strategy for monopolistic firms
Monopoly faces a downward sloping demand curve for its product, profit maximisation involves a trade off between price and quantity sold.

As the only seller in the market, the monopolist can determine the market price to charge, hoping to find the price and output combination that will bring the maximum profit to the firm.

Ro maximize profit, firms will expand output until its marginal revenue is equal to its marginal cost (i.e. MR = MC). Likewise, for the monopolist, the profit maximum output is at Q* with a price of P*. At this price and output level, **economic profit for the firm is maximised**. Due to high entry barriers, monopolies, profits do not attract new market entrants, therefore, long run positive economic profits can exist.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 18.03.56.png]]

### Monopolist vs perfect competition
An obvious criticism of monopoly markets is that when compared to a perfectly competitive market, the **monopoly market will produce less total output** and **charge a higher price**.

However, when a monopoly seeks to maximize profit by producing at a level where its (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), it increases its **producer surplus** but **at the expense of consumer surplus**.

Not only is this unfair to consumers, there's an economic deadweight loss, created by the monopoly produces a quantity that does not maximize the sum of consumer surplus and produce a surplus. Whereas in **perfect competition**, the **consumer surplus and producer surplus** are **maximised**.

From the **market perspective**, **monopoly is considered inefficient** because this area where the marginal benefit (MB; demand) is still greater than marginal cost is not realised (i.e. unrealised MB>MC â‡’ market inefficiency).

### Single pricing model vs. price discrimination
**Single pricing model**, that is the monopolist charges all its customers the same price for the product or service.

As a monopoly has the ability to set the market price, it can have **other pricing models**.

For illustration, let's assume the marginal cost of a monopolist product is constant at $30/unit, if the market demand function is 450 - P, we can also express the price as a function of the quantity, as follow:
$$\mathrm{Quantity=Market\,Demand-Price}$$
$$\mathrm{P=450-Q}$$
where Q: quantity; P: price; D: market demand.

The **total revenue (TR) function** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,Revenue=Quantity\times Price}$$
where TR: total revenue; Q: quantity; P: price. P can be substituted.

The marginal revenue of the firm is the change in **total revenue per unit, change in quantity**.
The **marginal revenue (MR) equation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Marginal\,Revenue=\frac{\Delta Total\,Revenue}{\Delta Quantity}}$$

with differentiate total revenue (TR), the equation is now as follows:
$$\mathrm{MR= MD - 2Q}$$
where MR: marginal revenue; MD: market demand; Q: quantity.

For **profit maximisation**, marginal revenue = marginal cost (i.e. MR = MC). 

Under a single pricing model, the monopolist will want to maximize its profit at the point where the MR equals MC. Plug this back into the **demand function** and we get a price of 240 dollars.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.01.39.png]]

#### Price discrimination
The monopolist probably realises that there's more profit to be earned by studying the demand curve. A downward sloping demand curve tells us that there are some customers who will still make the purchase if the price were higher and that additional sales could be made to customers who would purchase if the price were lower.

**Price discrimination** is a pricing strategy where charging different customers at different prices or service.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 19.59.32.png]]

So by practicing **price discrimination**, the monopolist earns extra by selling extra units at lower price. Notice also that through **price discrimination**, the **consumer surplus is reduced** and so is the **economic deadweight loss**.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.12.26.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.13.31.png]]

An extreme and largely theoretical case of price discrimination is **perfect price discrimination**. If it were possible for the supplier to charge each consumer the maximum they're willing to pay for each unit, there would be no **economic deadweight loss** because a monopolist would produce the same quantity as under perfect competition.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.13.48.png]]

#### Conditions for price discrimination to work
There are 3 conditions for price discrimination to work:
- Downward-sloping demand curve
- $\ge$ 2 identifiable groups of customers with different price elasticities
- Prevent customers paying lower price from reselling

e.g. airline ticket pricing - business traveller lower price elasticity, and holidaymaker with higher price elasticity

### Natural monopoly
In some industries, the reason for monopoly is due to the **economics of production**.

When there are large economies of scale, it means that the **average cost (ATC) and marginal cost (MC) of production decreases** as a single firm produces greater and greater output. 

e.g. **Electric utility** -  fixed costs of producing electricity and building the power lines and related equipment to deliver it to homes are quite high.

The marginal cost (MC) of providing electricity to an additional home is therefore quite low, where the more electricity provided, the lower the average cost per kWh.

**Natural monopoly is efficient** because of the low cost when producing at scale, which can mean lower prices for consumers.  The entry of another firm into the industry would **divide the production between two firms and result in a higher average cost of production**. New entrant would push the producing at scale line to the left, thus increasing the average cost.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.52.27.png]]

#### Unregulated natural monopoly 
For a **single producer left unregulated**, a single price monopolist will maximize profits by producing where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) producing quantity (Q) and charging price at $P_{max}$. At the expense of consumers where the consumer surplus is reduced. The market, on the whole, is also less efficient as there is economic deadweight loss.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20.53.41.png]]

#### Regulated natural monopoly
For these reasons, governments tend to regulate the price charged by natural monopolies to improve resource allocation and protect consumers.

This may be done through:
- **average cost pricing** - most common form of regulation; zero economic profit
- **marginal cost pricing** - a monopolist makes an economic loss

**Average cost pricing** (i.e. D=ATC; P=ATC) is where the monopolist is required to price and its average cost of production. This increases the output and decreases price for consumers. At this level, the **monopolist earns zero economic profit** as the price just covers the cost of production, it just turns a **normal profit** to cover opportunity costs.

**Marginal cost pricing**, referred to as efficient regulation (i.e. D=MC), forces the monopolist to reduce price to the point where the firms MC curve intersects the market demand curve. This further increases output and reduces price, but causes the **monopolies to incur an economic loss because price is below ATC**.

Such a solution requires a government subsidy in order to provide the firm with a normal profit and prevent it from leaving the market entirely.

## Pricing strategy
The pricing strategy is dependent on the market structure, there are 4 types of market structures in the order of the number of firms in the market
- Perfectly competitive market
- Monopolistic competitive market
- Oligopoly market
- Monopoly market

Regardless of market structure, remember this golden rule that the profits of a firm are maximised when it produces at the point where the firm's marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). (i.e. MR = MC).

### In the short run for perfect competition, monopolistic competition, monopoly
Under **perfect competition**, firms are just market price takers, so it's demand curve is horizontal, where the market price is the marginal revenue, which is also the average revenue.

Under **monopolistic competition**, firms differentiate their products, so each firm has their own demand curve, which is downward sloping, the marginal revenue curve is also downward sloping with a steeper gradient.

For a **monopolist**, the firm's demand curve is the same as the markets demand curve, which is also downward sloping.

So let's say all the firms have the same marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) curves are shown, all three firms will produce at their profit maximising output where MR equals MC and earn economic profit in the short run.

### In the long run for perfect competition, monopolistic competition, monopoly

In the long run, as there are low barriers to entry for competitive markets, new entrants will be attracted by the economic profit, increasing competition, and thus the firm's demand curve will be lowered. So in the long run, firms in competitive markets will produce less and earn zero economic profit. In contrast, the monopoly market has high barriers to entry, so the monopolist remains unchallenged, economic profit is sustainable in the long run.

### Oligopoly
The oligopoly markets, the optimal pricing strategy depends on our assumptions about the market.

If we assume that there is **perfect collusion** amongst the firms, the **entire market acts like one big monopoly** all the firms collude to produce at the level where the market marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the market marginal cost (MC) (i.e. MR = MC). The price output combination is exactly the same as the monopoly market. The firms collude to charge a high price such that maximum profit is sustained in the long run.

At the other extreme, if we **assume perfect competition amongst the firm's market behavior is like a perfectly competitive market**, the price output combination is exactly the same as the perfectly competitive market. In the long run, MR will converge to the level of the minimum average cost of production (i.e. D = MR = AR) and no economic profit can be made.

These two, however, are extreme theoretical models in practice, as we've learned under the Nash equilibrium model, firms tend to cheat even when they are collusive agreements. Therefore, the long run outcome is indeterminate. We can only say that the price will be between the monopoly price and the perfect competition price.

#### Kinked demand model and oligopoly pricing structure
The **kinked demand model** assumes competitors will match a price decrease, but not a price increase to the firm's demand curve. Again, the profit maximising point for firms is where the marginal revenue equals marginal cost (i.e. MR = MC). However, there is a gap in the marginal revenue curve. Therefore, for many cost structures, the optimal quantity is the same. Firms have little incentive to deviate from the prevailing price as increasing price may result in a large drop in demand, while a drop in price may not gain the firm much more customers.

#### Dominant firm model and oligopoly pricing structure
Under the **dominant firm model**, we assume one firm has the lowest cost structure and a large market share as a result. The dominant firm will maximize profits by producing the quantity for which its marginal cost equal its marginal revenue and charge the price on its firm demand curve or that quantity. Other firms in the market will essentially take that price as a given and produce the quantity for which their marginal cost equals that price.

## Measuring market concentration
There are several ways of measuring market concentration:
- **Econometric approaches** - estimate the elasticity of demand and supply in a market
- **N-firm concentration ratio** - sum of the % market shares of the largest N firms
- **Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI**) - sum of the squares of the market shares of the largest N firms

**Market power** can be abused when one or more dominant firms choose to price and produce at levels that **maximize firm profits that result in market inefficiencies**. Such **inefficiencies come in the form of dead weight loss and reduced consumer surplus while producer surplus is maximised**. **Regulators** are in the business of **measuring the market power of large firms** and **ensure that their activities do not violate any anti competition laws**.

### Econometric approaches
If demand is very elastic, the market must be very close to perfect competition. I**f demand is inelastic, companies may have significant market power**. 

Regression analysis is useful in computing elasticity, but requires a large number of observations. e.g. average past sales data of the entire market or sales of individual firms in a single period.

Downside of econometric approaches is that a large quantity of data is required and that demand and supply are dependent on each other, it's very difficult to analyze the supply and demand of a market separately.

Similar measures that require much less data are more often used to obtain a quick estimate of market power.

### N-firm concentration ratio
The **N-firm concentration ratio** is calculated as the **sum of the % market shares of the largest N-firms in a market**.

e.g. If the market shares of a particular industry is as such, the five firm concentration ratio will be the sum of the market shares of the top five firms

There are some pros and cons of using N-firm concentration ratio:
- Simple to calculate and understand
- Does not directly quantify market power/elasticity of demand.
	- Firms with high market share may not necessarily mean high market power if the barriers to entry are low
- Insensitive to mergers among dominant firms

### Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI)
The **Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI)** is calculated as the **sum of the squares of the market, shares of the largest and firms in the market**. In general, a higher HHI indicates a more concentrated market, vice versa.
The HHI is widely used by competition regulators in granting approvals to potential mergers since the sensitivity is greater than the N-firm concentration ratio.
