## Leverage
### Definition
**Leverage** is measured as the **amount of fixed costs** a firm has. The higher the fixed costs, the higher the degree of leverage. In some places, leverage is also referred to as 'gearing'.

**Fixed costs** are expenses that are the **same regardless of the production and sales** of the company, these fixed costs may be:
- **fixed operating expenses** - rents/leases, depreciation, wages for salaried employees
- **Fixed financing costs** - interest payments on debt

Besides fixed costs, there are **variable costs**, which **fluctuate with the level of production and sales**, including:
- Cost of raw materials, shipping charges, wages for hourly employees, sales commissions

### Differences between high vs. low leverage in risk and profitability
**Leverage is higher** when there is **higher fixed cost**. You can see clearly the effect of leverage on a company's profitability and risk.

Having the more leveraged cost structure is more profitable when it sells more but it's also more risky,as any shortfall in sales can quickly translate into losses.

## Business risk and the degree of operating leverage
**Business risk** refers to the risk associated with a **firm's operating income or EBIT**.
Since the EBIT is the result of the firm's sales and the expenditures (COGS) necessary to produce the sales, the 2 main components of business risk are:
- **Sales risk** - the uncertainty about the firm's sales or revenue
- **Operating risk** - the uncertainty variable cost, operating expense (from fixed operating cost) - Operating risk refers to uncertainty about operating earnings arising from fixed production (operating) costs. (Module 35.1, LOS 35.a)

**The greater the degree of leverage, the greater is a firm's operating risk.**

Financial risk refers to the capital structure, while operating risk refers to the operating cost structure. A firm's capital structure is well within the control of management as to how much debt to assume. In contrast, a firm's operating cost structure is usually driven by industry characteristics. This distressed firm's specialist would be looking for firms with capital structure problems that can be solved with an increase in equity capital and a reduction in debt financing. Changing the operating characteristics of the industry is far more challenging.

### Degree of operating leverage (DOL)
**Degree of operating leverage (DOL)** of the company is the sensitivity of a firm's EBIT to its sales, and is defined by the ratio (i.e. % EBIT to % its sales).
The **degree of operating leverage** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DOL=\frac{\% \Delta Operating\,income\,(EBIT)}{\% \Delta number\,of\,units\,sold}}$$
where DOL: degree of operating leverage.
From rearranging the equation:
$$\mathrm{\% \Delta Operating\,income\,(EBIT)=\% \Delta number\,of\,units\,sold\times DOL}$$

e.g. a ratio of 3.0 means that for every 1% change in number of units sold, the operating income changes by 3%.

Alternatively, calculate DOL, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DOL=\frac{Q(P-V)}{Q(P-V)-F}}$$
where Q: the quantity of units sold; P: sale price per unit; V: variable cost per unit; F: fixed operating costs. **Note that should not include any fixed financing cost since only calculating in the operating leverage at this stage.**

Operating leverage is the trade off between fixed and variable costs. Higher operating leverage typically is indicative of a firm with higher levels of risk (greater income variance). Given the positive risk/return relationship, higher operating leverage firms are expected to have a higher rate of return. And, lower operating leverage firms are expected to have a lower rate of return.

### Example

In fact, if you plot the DOL of a firm at various levels of unit sales, you get this peculiar graph.
This break here is the point where the denominator is zero which is the quantity at which the firm sells just enough to cover the fixed operating costs (breakeven).

Alternatively, calculate DOL, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DOL=\frac{S-TVC}{S-TVC-F}}$$
where S: sales (revenue); TVC: total variable cost; F: fixed operating costs.

## Financial risk and the degree of financial leverage
**Financial risk** is the **additional risk** to a firm's shareholder when it uses **debt financing**. 
**Fixed financing costs** **reduce the amount of net income** that increases the equity of the firm and it's a risk to shareholders.

When a company takes on **debt, it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments**. **The greater the proportion of debt in a firm's capital structure, the greater the firm's financial risk.**

The key to finding the optimal capital structure is identifying the level of debt that will maximize firm value. Earnings and earnings per share are not critical in and of themselves when assessing firm value, because they do not consider risk.

### Degree of financial leverage
**Degree of financial leverage (DFL)** is the sensitivity of the net income when operating income changes (i.e. % change in net income to % change of EBIT). 

The **degree of financial leverage** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DFL=\frac{\% \Delta Net\,income}{\% \Delta Operating\,income  \,(EBIT)}}$$
e.g. a DFL ratio of 3.0 means that for every 1% change in operating income, the net income changes by 3%.

Alternatively, calculate DFL, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DFL=\frac{EBIT}{EBIT -I}}$$
where I: interest expense. DFL should be independent of taxes.

### Financial leverage risk and return
As implied by the formula, the higher the interest expense which is a fixed cost, the higher the degree of financial leverage.

While taking on more debt can potentially multiply the net income of the firm and shareholder wealth when sales are good, the leverage works both ways and can magnify losses when sales are bad.

Therefore, the higher the financial leverage, the higher the risk to the shareholders. However, higher risk can also come with a potential of higher returns to the shareholders. This is evident in the effect of financial leverage on the return on equity of a firm.

A firm's management should balance the need for the firm's expansion through debt issuance, yet taking care of shareholders' interests at the same time by not taking excessive risks.

#### Financial leverage and ROE
It may appear that Poma shareholders (no leverage) are better off, but if we calculate the return on equity for both firms, Adodos' ROE is 22.5%, much higher than Poma's ROE of 15%.

The equation of ROE (return on equity) is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE=\frac{Net\,income}{Equity}}$$

Although the interest expense associated with using debt represents a fixed cost that reduces net income, the income is spread over a smaller base of shareholders equity, thereby magnifying the ROE.

The bottom line, financial leverage increases the risk and potential returns to a company's shareholders.

## Degree of total leverage
**Degree of total leverage (DTL)** is the sensitivity of a firm's net income to its sales. 
To put it simply, multiply a firm's degree of operating leverage (DOL) with its degree of financial leverage (DFL), is the degree of total leverage (DTL).

The equation of **degree of total leverage (DTL)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTL=\frac{\% \Delta Net\,income}{\% \Delta Number\,of\,units\,sold}}$$
where DTL: degree of total leverage.

Alternatively, calculate DTL from DOL and DFL, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTL=DOL\times DFL}$$

Alternatively, calculate DTL, the DTL equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTL=\frac{Q(P-V)}{Q(P-V)-F-I}}$$

Ultimately, can express the DTL equation as income sheet items as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTL=\frac{S-TVC}{S-TVC-F -I}}$$
where S: sales (revenue); TVC: total variable cost; F: fixed operating costs; I: Interest costs.

### Stakeholders and leverage concerns
A firm's management will be more concerned with the factors separately as its investments decisions affect the fixed operating costs of the firm which determines the operating leverage,

while the financing decisions affect the fixed financing costs of the firm which determines the financial leverage of the firm.

Shareholders, on the other hand, may be more concerned with the combined effect because they're primarily concerned with the net profit of the firm. The degree of total leverage gives them an idea of the factor that converts the company's sales to profits.

## Breakeven point
**Cost structure** of a firm consists of:
- **Fixed financing costs**
- **Fixed operating costs**
- **Variable costs**

If we plot a firm's total costs against the number of units it produced and sold, we get this upward sloping straight line where the steepness is determined by the **variable cost per unit**.

The **breakeven point** is the number of units a firm needs to produce and sell in order to fully **cover all of its variable and fixed costs**. The revenue line against the number of units sold,
and the intersection between the two lines is the breakeven point where revenue equals total cost.

The **contribution margin** is the difference between the price and variable cost per unit (i.e. contribution margin = price - variable cost (per unit)).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.32.15.png|600]]

When the contribution margin widens, the breakeven quantity is reduced. Conversely, when it narrows, the breakeven quantity increases.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.39.24.png|350]]![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.39.37.png|350]]

If the sales price per unit cannot even cover the variable cost, the breakeven quantity is infinite and the company should probably shutdown.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.41.03.png|400]]

The equation of **breakeven point** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Q_{breakeven}=\frac{O+F}{P-V}}$$
where Q: quantity of units sold; P: price per unit; V: variable cost per unit; O: fixed operating cost; F: fixed financing cost.

Sometimes excluding financing costs in order to make better comparisons across companies with different capital structures.

The equation of **operating breakeven point** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Q_{Operating.\,breakeven}=\frac{O}{P-V}}$$
