## Categories with traditional investment
### Differences with traditional investments
There are three main types of differences between **traditional** and **alternative investments**:
- Type of assets/securities
- Structure
- Characteristics

#### Type of assets/securities
**Traditional investments** are investments where centred around stocks and bonds (fixed-income) instruments. 

**Alternative investments** can include:
- Stocks
- Bonds
- Derivatives
- Real estate

The assets can be bought with leverage, and short positions.

#### Structure
The traditional investment tend to have simpler structure, where the asset is distributed by the issuer and the investor invest in that asset. Whereas in **alternative investments**, the issuer issue the securities/asset to the **General Partner** (i.e. **Fund**), and the **investor** are the **Limited Partners**. **Limited partner** is that the limited partnerâ€™s liability is limited to the amount of their investment in the company. The **Fee structure** is with higher management fee + incentive fee based on performance.

#### Characteristics
Generally, the **alternative investments**:
- have **low returns correlation** with traditional investments
- â†“ liquidity
- Specialisation by investment managers
- â†“ regulation and transparency
- different legal issues and tax treatments
- more problematic and less available data

#### Summary of the differences between traditional and alternative investment

## Categories of alternative investments
There are several categories of alternative investments:
- Hedge funds
- Private capital
- Real estate
- Natural resources
- Infrastructure 
- Others

#### Hedge fund
**Hedge fund** is a private investment vehicle that manage portfolios of securities and derivatives positions using a variety of strategies, e.g.:
- Long/short positions
- Highly leveraged
- Independent investment performance

#### Private capital
**Private equity** invest in the equity of companies that are not publicly listed or traded, or publicly traded firms that intends to take private. Strategy that **PE firms** use are leveraged buyout - to purchase established companies and work with existing management. **Venture capital** invest in **start-ups** with potential.

Another type of **private capital** is **private debt**, there are some forms of debt that they offer:
- Direct lending
- Mezzanine loans
- Venture debt
- Distressed debt

#### Real estate
There are **direct** and **indirect** investment of real estate:
- **Direct** - investing in residential properties, commercial properties
- **Indirect** - real-estate backed debt, private commercial real estate debt/equity, REITS, MBS

#### Natural resources
There are some type of commodities which investors can invest in:
- Grains
- Metals
- Crude oil
- Coffee
- Cotton
- Timerland/farmland

Investors can gain exposure through:
- Physically owning the asset
- Derivatives
- Producer shares

#### Infrastructure
There are some of the large public infrastructure which needs investment:
- Airport
- Utility grids
- Hospitals

Investors can gain indirect exposure though:
- Company shares
- ETFs
- PE funds
- Listed funds
- Unlisted funds

#### Others
There are other alternative investments, mainly divided into **tangible** and **intangible** assets.
**Tangible assets**:
- Fine wines
- Stamps
- Automobiles
- Antiques
- Art
- Shoes
- Watches

**Intangible assets**:
- Patents

## Alternative investments in a portfolio
### Benefits of alternative investment in portfolio
As we've mentioned earlier, alternative investment returns have historically had **low correlations** with those of traditional investments.

So for a manager whose portfolio consists mainly of traditional assets like stocks and bonds, he can consider adding alternative investments to the mix. As you learn under portfolio management, adding assets with low correlation of returns with a portfolio can have the effect of **reducing the overall portfolio risk**.

So if a manager adds alternative investments into his portfolio mix, the **expected standard deviation is likely to be lower**. **However, risk measures like standard deviation** that we use for traditional assets **may not be adequate to capture the risk characteristics** of alternative investments.

When considering potential portfolio combinations, **historical downside frequencies and worst return in a month may be included** in the analysis.

Besides low return correlation, **historical returns for alternative investments have been higher** on average than for traditional investments. As such, adding alternative investments to the portfolio may increase expected returns.

### Why do alternative investments have higher returns?
- Less efficiently priced â‡’ opportunities for skilled managers
- Liquidity premium â‡’ priced to give higher returns as compensation for illiquidity
- Use of leverage â‡’ more â†‘ risk and â†‘ return

### Biases of alternative historical return performance
Two of the most common biases are the **survivorship bias** and the **backfill bias**.

#### Survivorship bias
Since surviving firms tend to be those that had better returns, excluding the returns, data for failed firms results in average returns that are biased upward.

#### Backfill bias
Backfill bias can be introduced when new funds are added to a benchmark index, since funds that are newly added to an index tend to be those that have outperformed better than average, including their returns for prior years tends to bias the index returns upward.

## Methods of investing in alternative investments
There are three main methods in investing in alternative investments:
- Fund investing
- Direct investing
- Co-investing

### Fund investing
**Fund investing** is a type of indirect investment where investors come together and invest the money in the fund, and the fund manager invest on behalf of the clients to underlying assets. The fund manager will charge the investors management fee and incentive fee according to the fund performance.

Advantage of fund investing:
- Management expertise
- Less involvement 
- Less required expertise from the investor
- Greater diversification of assets
- Lower minimum fee required

Disadvantage of fund investing:
- charged significant fees
- still charge fees if the fund is not performing well

Due diligence:
- Manager conduct due diligence on underlying assets
- investor conduct due diligence when choosing fund

#### Investment structure
Investment structure for fund investing, the fund manager is the general partner (GP), whereas the investors are limited partners (LP). They have signed a agreement of limited partnership agreement (LPA).

The fund manager (i.e. general partner) bears the unlimited liability if anything goes wrong with the investment.

The fund manager generally charged two fees: **management fee** + **incentive fee**. The **management fee** in the hedge fund is around 1%-2% AUM or **committed capital** for **private equity fund**. The **incentive fee** is also known as performance fee, it is around 20% of excess return.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 17.56.10.png]]

### Direct investing
**Direct investing** are investors without intermediary fund manager and directly investing into the underlying assets. These are for larger and sophisticated investor (e.g. pension fund, and sovereign wealth fund).

Advantage of direct investing:
- greater flexibility and control
- no fees to outside managers

Disadvantage of direct investing:
- less asset diversification
- require greater expertise

Due diligence:
- Investor conduct due diligence on underlying assets with support of fund manager

### Co-investing
**Co-investing** is a hybrid of fund-investing and direct investing, where the investor can invest in the fund and has the right to invest directly alongside fund manager.

Advantage of co-investing:
- manager expertise from the fund manager
- reduces overall fees
- more control over the asset collection

Due diligence:
- Investor conduct own due diligence on underlying assets

## Hedge fund strategies
### Characteristics of hedge fund
There are several characteristics of hedge fund:
- aggressively managed portfolio
- highly leveraged
- across asset classes
- long/short positions
- across regions
- use of derivatives

### Hedge fund return objectives
Since hedge funds are less regulated than traditional investment, they tend to take on higher risk to achieve higher returns.

The hedge fund returns are stated on:
- absolute basis
- relative basis

**Absolute basis** is a mode of hedge fund return seeking an absolute % of return on annual/quarterly/monthly basis.
**Relative basis** is a mode of hedge fund return objective against a specified benchmark.

### Hedge fund structure
The managing firms is the general partner, and the investors are limited partners. 

The managing firm earns both:
- **management fee** - % of portfolio value
- **incentive fee** - based on returns

The investors normally to have strict criteria to be able to invest in these hedge fund:
- adequate wealth
- sufficient liquidity
- investment sophistication

Hedge funds are generally less liquid than traditional investment, it has a **lockup period**, where investors have the minimum period before investors can make redemptions. At the same time, there is a **notice period**, which is number of days to redemption after notice is given, typically on 30-90 days basis, on top of that there might be a fee to pay to redeem the investment.

##### Fund of hedge funds (FOF)
**Fund of hedge funds (FOF)** is investment company that **invests in hedge funds**, it allows for **diversification benefits** and the hedge funds may be open to limited investors, it **allow smaller investors to access hedge funds** in which they may not be able to invest directly. There will be **an additional layers of fees charged by fund of hedge funds** as the FOF manager takes an additional layer of fees.

### Hedge fund strategies
There are broadly 4 types of strategies:
- **Event-driven strategies**
- **Relative value strategies**
- **Macro strategies**
- **Equity hedge strategies**

#### Event-driven strategies
There are several types of event-driven strategies:
- **Profit** from **short-term events**:
	- **Profit** through Long/short - common/preferred stocks, debt securities, options
	- **Short term events**: corporate restructuring, corporate acquisition
- **Merger arbitrage** -  **SHORT** the acquired and **LONG** the acquiree to get the **deal spread** - which reflects the uncertainty of deal closing; risk: announced acquisition may not occur.
- **Distressed/restructuring** - this strategy involves in buying the firm's share of a distressed firm which will undergo restructuring. If the restructured firm is successful, then the firm's share price will increase. 
- **Distressed/restructuring another strategy**: as the situation worsen, there will be wider spreads. eg. **LONG** senior debt, **SHORT** junior debt; **LONG** preferred shares, **SHORT** common stock.
- **Activist shareholder**: if the firm is promising and the hedge fund manager do have strategies to help growing the firm, buying sufficient shares to have influence on the firm's policies.
- **Special situation**: Investing in firms that are engaged in **restructuring activities** like:
	- issuing or repurchasing securities
	- spinning off divisions
	- selling assets
	- distributing capital

### Relative value strategies
**Relative value strategies** involves in **buying** a **security** and **selling short** a **related security** and to profit when the pricing discrepancy is resolved
There are few of the pricing discrepancies between 2 or more related securities:
- **Fixed income convertible arbitrage** - between convertible bonds and the common stock of the issuing companies
- **Fixed income asset-backed** - among various MBS or ABS
- **Fixed income general** - between fixed income securities of various types
- **Volatility** - from differences between returns volatility (implied by option prices) and expectations of future volatility
- **Multi-strategy** - among securities across asset classes and markets

### Macro strategies
**Macro strategies** are strategies based on macroeconomic views and to **LONG/SHORT** equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. These are said to be from a "top-down" approach as the investment decisions are made at the macro level. 

#### Equity hedge strategies
**Equity hedge strategies** are mostly adopt by hedge fund managers where **LONG/SHORT** equities and equity derivatives, and have "bottom-up approach", decisions are made on individual securities and companies.

There are several equity hedge strategies:
- Market neutral
- Quantitative directional 
- Fundamental growth
- Fundamental value
- Short bias

One of the example is **market neutral** approach, where the hedge fund manager uses technical analysis and fundamental analysis to **LONG** undervalue equities and **SHORT** overvalue equities. The **LONG/SHORT** positions are taken as approximate equal amount to minimise the exposure to market risk.

Another one is **quantitative directional**, where only uses technical analysis and to **LONG** undervalued and **SHORT** overvalued equities and equity derivatives. Unlike **market neutral** approach, it does not have a similar **LONG/SHORT** position sizing.

**Fundamental growth** is another type of strategy where to **LONG** high growth companies. 
**Fundamental value** is again using fundamental analysis to **LONG** undervalued companies. 

**Short bias** takes on a predominant short position for overvalued company through technical analysis and fundamental analysis. The hedge fund might have small undervalued small long position, but generally the predominant short position put them as negative market exposure.

Most hedge fund started of with one strategy, then as they grow, they turn to multi-strategy hedge fund.

**A hedge fund investor finds that funds with better historical returns does not necessarily carry through the same performance in the future. What could be the most likely reason?**
This is known as lack of persistence in returns, and is usually due to the previously profitable strategies becoming less profitable as more funds pursue the same strategy.

## Hedge fund diversification
There are multiple ways of diversification of hedge funds:
- diverse strategies
- diverse regions
- diverse asset classes

General performance:
- when the equity market is â†“, the hedge fund return generally > equity return
- when the equity market is â†‘, the hedge fund return generally < equity return

General diversification benefits:
- correlation between equities and hedge funds < 1
- however, at times of financial crisis, the correlation â†‘

## Hedge fund fee structures
The general hedge fund structure is **"2 and 20"**, and it refers to the 2% management fee and 20% of incentive fee. Whereas fund of hedge fund fee is **"1 and 10"**, and it refers to the 1% management fee and 10% of incentive fee, which is on top of those hedge fund fee. 

The management fee is based on the beginning value of the period and the ending value of the period. The incentive fee is calculated based on the gains in value for that specific period. 
There are several ways of calculating the incentive fee:
- gains in value
- gains in value - management fees
- gains in excess of hurdle rate

#### Hurdle rate
**Hurdle rate** can be set as absolute or relative to benchmark.
There are two types of hurdle rate:
- **Hard hurdle** - incentive fee is only paid on returns in excess of hurdle
- **Soft hurdle** - incentive fee is paid on all returns, provided hurdle rate is met

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.07.34.png]]

There might be a **"catch-up clause"** for GP that undergoes hard hurdle. The GP will collect 100% return above the hurdle until it receives full 20% incentive fees. For the remaining returns, go through the 80/20 split (20% incentive fee to GP).

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.09.53.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.10.52.png]]

### High water mark
**High water mark** ensures that investors will not be charged twice on the same gains, incentive fees apply only to the extent that the account value is above the highest value previously recorded.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.12.21.png]]

## Example

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.18.18.png]]

## Negotiated hedge fund fee structure
Since it is now more a competitive landscape, the fees can be negotiated based on:
- size of the investment (larger commitments â‡’ lower fees)
- liquidity provisions (longer lockup/notice period â‡’ lower fees)
- hurdle rates (hard vs soft; catch-up provision)
- either/or fees (either management or incentive; whichever is greater) - may be stipulate that if there are no profits for the year, 1% management fees paid would be subtracted from incentive fees when they are paid in a subsequent year
- founders share - "1.5 and 10"

It should be listed on the Limited Partner Agreement (LPA) on how the hedge fund charges fee differently with the general consensus.

## Private capital
**Private capital** refers to investment made to private entities through equity or debt.

## Private equity
**Private equities** invest in privately-owned companies or investing in public companies with intention to take them private.

### Private equity strategies
There are 3 major types of private equity strategies:
- Leveraged buyout (LBO) 
- Venture capital (VC)
- Development capital (DC)

#### Leveraged buyout (LBO)
- significant % of the purchase price are financed through debt
- the target firm can increase potential value through:
	- management incentives
	- restructuring
	- cost-reduction
	- revenue enhancement
- **Note**: it can either be **management buyout (MBOs)** where the **existing management team stay to implement** or **management buy-ins (MBIs)** where **external management replace the current team**

##### Debt financing
Since it requires **debt financing**, the target firm normally has assets act as collaterals to provide cash flows to service the debt. If the buyout goes through, then now the debt will be part of the target firms' balance sheet.

#### Venture capital
**Venture capital** invest in companies in the early stages of their development, it provides funds to startup companies in the forms of:
- equity
- convertible preferred shares
- convertible debt

While it is a high risk investment, the returns on successful companies can be very high, where launching in IPO and offered in the public market.

Venture capital are closely involved with the portfolio companies, normally sitting at the boards or sitting at key management positions.

#### Categorisation of venture capital companies through stage of growth
There a typically 5 stages of a venture capital company:
- **Angel investing** - transform idea into business plan
- **Seed stage financing** - product development, marketing, research
- **Early stage financing** - initial production costs and sales expenses
- **Later stage financing** - expansion of production and increasing sales
- **Mezzanine stage financing** - to prepare for IPO


![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.39.48.png]]

#### Development capital
**Development capital** requires minority equity investing, for funding business growth or restructuring. Typically, it is for private company prior going to public, or it is also used in private investment in public equities (PIPEs).

### General private equity strategies
**Private equity** helps new/underperforming businesses in the average term of 5 years to turn it into a profitable business and exit at high valuations.

### Exit strategies
The restructured/financed business turn into profitable business can be exited through:
- IPO
- Trade sale
- Secondary sale
- Not ready for sale
- Failure (write off/liquidate)

All of these strategies maybe pursued individually, combined together, or used for a partial exit strategy.

#### Initial public offering (IPO)
**Initial public offering (IPO)** involves in selling all/some shares of the portfolio company to the public.

Advantage of IPO:
- potential for highest price
- management approval
- publicity for PE firm
- potential future upside

Disadvantage of IPO:
- high transaction cost to investment banks
- long lead times
- high disclosure requirements
- lock-up period

#### Trade sale
**Trade sale** is selling to a strategic buyer (e.g. competitor).

Advantage of trade sale:
- lower transaction cost
- immediate cash exit
- less disclosure requirements
- strategic buyer may pay more

Disadvantage of trade sale:
- possible lower price than IPO
- management disapproval
- less attractive to employees
- fewer potential buyers

#### Secondary sale
**Secondary sale** sell to another private equity firm or other group of investors

#### Not ready for sale
**Not ready for sale** is not a true exit strategy as the private equity firm still maintains control. It under go **recapitalisation**, where the company issues debt to fund a dividend distribution to equity holders â‡’ PE fund.

Recapitalisation is a strategy where the company issues debt to fund a distribution to equity holders (PE firm).

### Failure
If the PE firm **fails** to restructure the business to be valuated at a higher price in future, then they will have to consider to liquidate the company or to write-off. Selling off the assets of the company and concentrate on other viable projects.

### Summary of private equity (PE) exit strategy
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 18.20.43.png]]

### Risk and return of private equities
There are known risks and returns of private equities based on historical data:
- PE return > traditional assets return
	- ability to invest in private companies
	- influence on portfolio companies operations
	- use of leverage 
- Correlation of (PE return, traditional asset return) < 1
	- PE funds add **diversification benefits** to traditional portfolios
- PE standard deviation > Traditional assets standard deviation
	- higher risk in PE funds

However, the PE returns might be upwardly inflated due to:
- **survivorship bias** 
- **backfill bias** - Â when a new hedge fund is added to an index, the past performance of the fund is back-filled in the index.

Also, the **correlation** of return and **standard deviation** of returns can be **biased downwards**, which can lead to the diversification benefits overstated and riskier than reported.

It comes down to choosing the right manager when it comes to PE funds, as the top most quartile of PE funds can have very **significant differences in returns** and **persistence in performance ranking** compared with the lowest quartile of PE funds.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 20.54.40.png]]

### Fee structure of private equity (PE)
Most of the private equity charge as a private equity firm (General Partner):
- Management fee (1-3% of committed capital)
- Incentive fee (Typically 20%)
and the investors are Limited Partners.

The **committed capital** is the amount that the Limited Partners have agreed to provide to the PE fund. 

**Before** the committed capital is fully drawn down (typically 3-5 years), the **management fee** is calculated based on **total committed capital**. The committed capital that is yet to be drawn down is known as **dry powder**. The **full committed capital** is charged the management fee, even though not all have been invested.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 18.30.56.png]]

**After** committed committed capital has been fully drawn down, the management fee is based on the remaining invested funds.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 18.31.52.png]]
### Incentive fees for private equity fund
**Incentive fees** are based on profits booked from exiting investments (might be subjected to hurdle rate, and no hurdle rate assumed in this scenario for simplicity).

The profits from the deal are flowed to the GP and LP according to the waterfall system, it can be either **American** or **European**.

Under **American waterfall** system, the profits are distributed as each deal is exited. It is also known as the "deal-by-deal" system.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 18.37.42.png]]

Under the **European waterfall** system, the incentive fee is based on **aggregate profit** for the whole fund. This is known as "Whole-of-fund" waterfall. In this situation, the LPs should receive all distributions until they have 100% of their initial investments.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 18.39.22.png]]

### Problems of private equity fund incentive fees 
The **American waterfall** system is on a "deal-by-deal" basis and since that is the case, the incentive fees might be sky-high. There is a clawback provision, which allows LPs the right to reclaim part of GP's incentive fee.

**European waterfall** system have time risk, particularly maturity/time risk/liquidity problems, where the investor would like to have the money but they have to wait for a long period of time until all of the profits are realised at the end of the project.

## Private debt
There are 4 types of **private debt**:
- Direct lending
- Mezzanine debt
- Venture debt
- Distressed debt

### Direct lending
**Direct lending** acts similar to a bond, where there is a loan agreement.
The loan agreement will list out:
-  a fixed payment schedule
- normally, **senior rank**
- secured with collaterals
- with covenants.
However, unlike bonds, these private debts cannot be traded publicly on the market. 
Normally, the private debt firm gather investors' capital as the private debt do give **higher yield** than public bonds.

Private debt firms also give out in the form of leveraged loan as part of the capital is borrowed capital. Therefore, the private debt firm performance would be better.

### Mezzanine debt
**Mezzanine debt** acts similar to a bond, where there is a loan agreement.
The loan agreement will list out:
-  a fixed payment schedule
- however, **subordinated**
- **unsecured**
- **convertible to shares rights or warrants**

Normally, the debts are subordinated/junior and unsecured. Therefore, the loan normally have **convertible to shares rights or warrants** to compensate for higher risk.

### Venture debt
**Venture debt** is debt that are loaned out to startups/early stage firms.
The loan agreement will list out:
-  a fixed payment schedule
- **unsecured**
- **convertible to shares rights or warrants**

### Distressed debt
**Distressed debt** investors are the investors that will be actively managing and reorganising potentially/currently in default in bankruptcy proceedings private entities. This type of investors are called "vulture investor".

## Forms of commodity investments
**Commodities** are physical products that can be categorised as:
- **Energy** - oil, natural gas, coal
- **Base metals** - copper, aluminum, zinc
- **Precious metals** - gold, silver, platinum
- **Agriculture** - grains, livestock, coffee
- **Others** - carbon credits, freight, forest products

As compared to other products, commodities do not provide income stream through dividends and interest, instead, the investor profit from the changes in commodity prices.

Although it is possible to invest in the physical form, the investor can also invest in commodity derivatives.

### Commodity derivatives
**Commodity derivatives** normally come in form of:
- Futures
- Forwards
- Options
- Swaps

**Futures** and **Forwards** are **obligations to buy or sell** a specific amount of a given commodity at a given price on a specific date.

**Futures** are traded through central exchange, cash settled, and the price is marked to market daily, the counterparty risk is low as the contract is against the exchange (clearinghouse), and the exchange imposes margin requirements on all parties.

**Forwards** are traded through the OTC, there is a higher counter-party risk, with delivery of physical commodity is expected.

**Options** give the **buyer the right** to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a specified price within a predetermined time period, while the **seller is obligated** **to fulfil the contract if the buyer decides to execute it**. **Options** can be traded in both central exchange or OTC.

**Swaps** are exchange streams of cash flows based on future commodities price, it is considered as "series of forwards". **Forwards** are custom, non-standard contracts, less regulated and exposed to counter-party risk. **Swaps** are only traded in the OTC market.  

### Other means of achieving commodity exposure
There are other means of achieving commodity exposure without trading commodity derivatives:
- **Exchange traded funds (ETF)** - track the performance of specified commodities
- **Commodity producer shares** - equities directly linked to a commodity (eg. oil producers, gold mining company)
- **Managed futures fund** - actively managed funds focused on specific sectors, or diversified across a number of sectors - eg. GP & LP, mutual funds structure
- **Individual managed accounts** - individual accounts managed by professional managers
- **Specialised funds** - focus on specific commodity sectors (mainly oil and gas, grains, precious metals, or industrial metals; e.g. private energy partnerships)

### Benefits and downsides of using other means to achieve commodity exposure
#### ETF 
Suitable for investor who:
- can only buy equity shares
- seek connivence in trading

#### Commodity producer shares
Drawback:
- stock and commodity price movement are not perfectly correlated

#### Managed future funds
**Limited partnerships** - have "2 and 20 fee structure" and investor restrictions
**Mutual fund structure** - have shares that are available to the general public, â†“ minimum investment, â†“ fees, â†‘ liquidity

#### Individual managed accounts
- Tailored to individual portfolio needs
- Only available to high net-worth individuals or institutional investors

#### Specialised funds
A mixture of all of the above


## Potential benefits
**Commodity returns** based on historical data:
- Commodities return < traditional assets return
- Commodities standard deviation > traditional assets standard deviation (implies higher risk)

**Sharpe ratio of commodity**:
$$\mathrm{Sharpe\,ratio\,of\,commodities=\frac{Lower\,returns}{Higher \,st. dev.}}$$
 Low Sharpe ratio of commodity indication of the investor bears higher risk but lower returns.
 However, investors can benefit from:
 - potential for capital gain from short term commodities price movements
 - diversification benefits (low correlation: <0.2)
 - hedge against inflation (+ve correlation from commodity prices and inflation indices)

## Commodity prices and investments
### Factors that influence prices
Commodity spot price are influenced by **supply** and **demand**:
- **Supply** - production cost, storage cost, existing inventory
- **Demand** - value to consumer, global economic conditions

### Issue with supply and demand of commodities
- **Supply side**: long lead times alter production levels - supplies cannot catch up to unexpected change in demand
	- e.g. agricultural output - require at least one growing cycle, weather is unpredictable
	- e.g. oil and mining production - increase in production may require years, cost of extraction to access remote areas
- **Demand** side: global manufacturing dynamics, economic growth
	- Global manufacturing dynamics - manufacturing needs can be fickle as orders and inventories vary
	- Economic growth - economic growth can be unpredictable, particularly in emerging markets

**Supply** can be erratic. Producers are reluctant to adjust output due to long lead times. **Demand** can be fickle due to economic cycles and changes in technology.

**Commodity prices** can be predicted through:
- Analysing inventory levels
- Forecast of production
- Changes in government policy
- Expectation of economic growth

### Pricing commodity futures
The pricing of the commodities future based on:
- Spot price (discounted by the risk-free rate in future)
- Storage cost (compensate the SHORT)
- Convenience yield (to compensate the LONG)

The **commodities future price equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Futures\,price = Spot\,price (1+R_f)+Storage\,cost-Convenience\,yield}$$
where $(1+R_f)$: discount risk-free rate; Storage cost: to compensate SHORT; Convenience yield: to compensate LONG.


![[Screenshot 2023-03-21 at 21.01.49.png]]

### Contango and backwardation
So as you can observe, the futures price can be lower or higher than the spot price based on the convenience yield.

**Contango** is the phenomenon where futures price > spot price. If there is little or no convenience yield, the futures price will be higher than the spot price. 

**Backwardation** is the phenomenon where futures price < spot price (delivery date).
When the convenience yield is high, futures prices may be less than spot prices. Because commodities have no monetary yield, only a convenience yield greater than the opportunity (interest) cost and storage costs of holding the commodity can lead to backwardation. When a futures market is in backwardation, the roll yield is positive because the futures price moves towards the spot price over the life of the contract.

> A commodity has very little convenience yield, but the storage costs are high. What is the most likely effect on its futures price? **The futures price curve is in contango.**
> 
> Futures price = Spot price (1+Rf) + Storage Costs â€“ Convenience Yield  
> Assuming positive risk-free rate, the futures price will be higher than spot price as the storage costs exceed the convenience yield.  
> Contango is the phenomenon where futures price > spot price.


## Sources of commodities futures returns
There are 3 sources of commodities future returns:
- Collateral yield
- Change in spot price
- Roll yield

### Roll yield
**Roll yield** is the difference between the spot price and futures price at initiation. It's called the roll yield because the futures price **rolls** towards the spot price as the contract gets closer to expiration.

The equation of roll yield is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Roll\,yield=Spot\,price-Future\,price}$$

The roll yield is just one component of commodities, futures returns.

### Change in spot price
The **change in spot price** is another form of source of commodities future returns. This increase in spot price is also a form of return to the LONG.

### Collateral yield
**Collateral yield** is the yield that can earn interest for the period it is placed as collateral.

## Timberland and Farmland
**Timberland and farmland** are considered as natural resources or "real estate". The investment income comes from sales of timber and sales of agricultural products.

### Timberland 
The sales of timber returns are not highly correlated with other asset classes:
- timber easily stored by not harvesting
- flexibility of delaying harvests when prices are low
- harvest more trees when timber prices are high

### Farmland
The sales of agricultural products are correlated with inflation:
- have little flexibility in timing harvest as it does not allow storage 
- however, it provides inflation hedge.

### Capital appreciation of timberland and farmland
Both assets class allow investors to have land price appreciation. At the same time, the produce and lumber price for farmland and timberland respectively. Due to the ESG practices, the timberland and farmland investments are more attractive to ESG investors.

### Risks of timberland and farmlands
- Low liquidity
- High fixed cost of production
- Dependence on weather
- Natural disasters

> Camilia desires a form of real estate investment in which the returns is quite stable, and not highly correlated with other forms of real estate. Which of the following best meets her criteria? **Timberland**
> 
> Timber can be easily stored by not harvesting, so there is the flexibility of harvesting more when price is high, and harvesting less when price is low. This brings about income stability, and the returns are not highly correlated with other forms of real estate.

## Real estate investments
### Forms of real estate investments
**Real estate** allows for **cash flow** in terms of "**rent**" and **capital gain** when exit. Real estate as an asset class can provide diversification benefits to an investor's portfolio and a potential inflation hedge because rents and real estate values tend to increase with inflation.

#### Real estate investment types
Real estate investment can broadly divided into:
- **Equity investment** - investor takes ownership, receives rental income, capital gains (e.g. REITS, commercial real estate equity)
- **Debt investment** - investor receives interest (e.g. MBS, real-estate backed debt, private commercial real estate debt)

There are 2 major type of real estate markets:
- **Residential properties**:
	- If you own the home, you can be considered as residential property investor
	- If you finance your home with a mortgage, the financial institution that lent to you is considered the debt holder of the property and you were considered the equity holder of the property.
- **Commercial real estate**:
	- If you bought a property with the intention to generate rental income and you do not stay in it, this is classified as a commercial real estate.
	- Note this distinction: A commercial property does not just refer to offices, hotels, malls, hospitals and industrial buildings. If a residential property is purchased for rental income, it's considered as commercial real estate in this case.

There are several ways of investing commercial real estate:
- Single investor
- Joint venture
- Limited partnership
Likewise, several financial institutions like banks also provide debt financing for commercial properties.

Besides, one related loan is construction loans, where the financial institutions provide financing for the construction of the properties.

There are private market and public market for real estate investment:
- **Private** - direct ownership
- **Public** - indirect ownership 
	- e.g. Real estate investment trust (REITS); it is a form of publicly traded shares to investors where the rental income (around 90% of income) must be distributed to shareholders 
	-  e.g. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS): pool of mortgages where securitised into different tranches (e.g. senior, junior and sub tranches)

### Measuring performance of real estate
There are several indices measuring of real estate performance:
- **Appraisal indices** - based on **periodic estimates** of property values by experts; shortcomings: can be subjective, infrequent appraisals â‡’ lower volatility than actual sales
- **Repeat sales indices** - based on change in prices of properties with repeat sales; shortcomings: properties sold in a period may not be representative of market â‡’ sample selection bias
- **REIT indices** - based on the actual trading prices of **REIT shares**; shortcoming: index is not necessarily representative of the properties of interest

### Benefits of real estate
#### Real estate
**Real estate** generally have low correlation with traditional asset returns â‡’ direct real estate investments may have good diversification benefits. However, the methods of index construction may be a factor in the low reported correlation â‡’ actual benefits may be less than expected.

#### Real estate investment trusts (REITS)
**REITS** are publicly traded shares which will have strong correlation with equity, low correlation with bonds â‡’ REITS may have good diversification benefits for portfolios heavy in bonds.

### Factors to consider in real estate investment
There are several factors to consider in real estate investment:
- Global and national economic growth
- Local real estate market conditions
- Interest rate levels

If investing in REITS:
- Manager skills are important, such as:
	- selecting
	- financing (degree of leverage using debt and equity â‡’ as it amplifies gains and losses)
	- managing properties

Property under development, there are â†‘ risk due to:
- **Regulatory issues** - zoning, obtaining permits, environmental considerations
- **Changes in economic condition** - renders property's value lower than expected after completion
- **Inability to get long-term financing** - projects may end up incomplete

## Infrastructure investments
**Infrastructure investments** are categorised by:
- asset type
- stage of development
- geographical location

### Ways of categorisation
#### Asset type
**Economic infrastructure** supports economic activities:
- **Transportation** - roads, airports, ports, railway
- **Utility** - Gas distribution, electric generation, waste management
- **Communication** - Broadcast/transmission

**Social infrastructure** are directed toward human activities:
- Educational
- Healthcare
- Prisons

#### Stage of development
Stage of development:
- **Brownfield investment** - existing investable infrastructure; it can be lease out but owned by the government
- **Greenfield investment** - to be constructed; it can be leased or sell to the government

#### Geographical location
**Geographical location** of developed or developing countries can provide diversification of portfolio.

### Investment forms
There are two major forms of investment:
- **Direct investment** 
- **Indirect investment**

#### Direct investment
**Direct investment** provide some benefits and shortcomings:
- control over the asset
- opportunity to capture full value of asset
- large investment â‡’ concentration and liquidity risks
- asset must be managed and operated

#### Indirect investment
**Indirect investment** through company shares, ETFs, PE funds, Master limited partnerships(MLPs):
- liquidity, reasonable fees
- transparent governance, market prices
- diversify across underlying assets
- small segment of investment universe
- clustered in certain categories of assets

**Master limited partnerships (MLP)** are similar to REITs, where they are pass-through entities where the free cash flows are allocated to the investors for taxation. The **general partner** manages the partnership, receives a fee, holds a small interest, whereas the limited partner hold the rest of the partnership interest.

### Risks and returns of infrastructure investments
**Risks and returns of infrastructure investment** depends on the **asset type**, **stage of development** and **geographical location**.

**Brownfield investment**:
- provides stable cash flows
- relatively high yields
- little growth potential

**Greenfield investment**:
- uncertain cash flows
- relatively lower yields
- greater growth potential

Despite infrastructure investment might provide diversification, there are specific risks:
- Regulatory risks
- Risk from financial leverage
- Cash flow less than expected
- Construction risk
- Operational risk (for privately-owned assets)

## Issues in performance appraisal for alternative investment
In general, **alternative investments** are used for **portfolio diversification benefits**, low correlation to traditional investments, and expected higher returns than traditional investments. However, it encompasses risks considerations broadly characterise as **characteristics issues** and **management issues**.

### Key risk management issues
There are some key characteristics issues:
- **Lack of transparency** (hedge funds and PE funds) - as they consider the strategies are proprietary, they cannot be disclosed, but it makes it difficult for investors to conduct due diligence
- **Illiquid investments** - therefore it usually provides liquidity premium to compensate for liquidity risk, long lockup periods, PE funds and hedge funds tie up investor's funds for initial years
- **Use of derivatives** - introduces operational, financial, counter-party and liquidity risks
- **Use of high leverage** - has potential to multiply losses

Also, some manager issues:
- **Manager performance** (Hedge funds and PE funds) - expertise and execution of the manager, manager underperformance is a real and significant risk
- **Illiquid nature** â‡’ poor manager selection can create a lingering drag on investor's portfolio
- **Fees** - management fees and performance fees, high fees can be a drag to the actual returns received by the investor

### Risk-adjusted return
There are 4 ratios of calculating the risk taken to generate the return:
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino ratio
- Treynor ratio
- Calmar ratio

All of the ratios require extensive historical data. Regardless on any of the ratio used, the higher the risk-adjusted return the better the investment/portfolio performance.

#### Sharpe ratio
**Sharpe ratio** is one of the ratio to measure the return over the risks endured, however it comes with an **upward bias** due to **return distributions are not normal**, and **price volatility is smoothed**. 

**Sharpe ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Sharpe\,ratio=\frac{R_i-R_f}{\sigma_i}}$$
where $R_i$:ActualÂ orÂ expectedÂ investmentÂ return; $R_fâ€‹$=Risk-freeÂ rate; $\sigma_{i}$: standard deviation of investment return; and $(R_i-R_f)$: excess return.

##### Return distribution is not normal
However, the returns distributions are not normal, they tend to be **leptokurtic** (fatter tails) and **negatively skewed** (fatter left tail). Therefore, the standard deviation (s in sample size or $\sigma$ in population) is not at all a proper risk measurement.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 16.32.49.png]]

##### Price volatility is smoothed
The price volatility is smoothed (for estimated values) â‡’ standard deviation underestimated, for example estimated using appraisals/models (e.g. real estate index).

#### Sortino ratio
**Sortino ratio** is a variation of theÂ Sharpe ratioÂ that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returnsâ€”downside deviation.

The equation of **Sortino ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Sortino\,ratio = \frac{R_{p}- R_f}{\sigma_{d}}}$$
where $R_p$â€‹: ActualÂ orÂ expectedÂ portfolioÂ return; $R_fâ€‹$=Risk-freeÂ rate; $\sigma_{d}$: standardÂ deviationÂ ofÂ theÂ downsideâ€‹ (i.e. only losses occur on the left side of return distribution, lower than the mean expected return) - be mindful it's not the same as Sharpe ratio as it only consider downside.

However, both **Sharpe and Sortino ratios** do not take into account diversification benefits from low correlation between alternative investments and traditional investments. 

#### Treynor ratio
**Treynor ratio** is another better measurement for risk in a portfolio, where it takes into account of beta. **Beta** is a measure of single asset risk vs. market risk. It will be detailed in portfolio management.

$$\mathrm{Treynor\,ratio = \frac{R_{p}- R_f}{\beta}}$$
where $R_p$â€‹:ActualÂ orÂ expectedÂ portfolioÂ return; $R_fâ€‹$=Risk-freeÂ rate; $\beta$: beta.

**Beta**
$\beta > 1$: Market risk < asset risk
$\beta < 1$: Market risk > asset risk 
Lower beta indicate a low correlation with traditional investments (equity market).

#### Calmar ratio
**Calmar ratio** is a simpler ratio compared to **Treynor, Sortino and Sharpe ratio**. It is a ratio that uses average annual compound return over maximum drawdown.

$$\mathrm{Calmar\,ratio = \frac{Avg. annual\,compound\,return}{Max\,drawdown}}$$

## Issues in determining return for PE/Real estate investments
Generally, the industry standard uses **multiple of invested capital (MOIC)** as a measure to measure the success of the fund.

The **multiple of invested capital (MOIC)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{MOIC= \frac{Total\,distribution+Residual\,asset\,values}{Total\,capital}}$$
where MOIC: multiple of invested capital.

Most of the PE/Real estate fund experience a **J-curve effect**, where in the early years of investment, the fund is running on negative unrealised return, and only in the maturity period, the investment is generating positive realised return.

In the early period, there is a fee drag for **investors** (i.e. management fee for PE based on committed capital) and **refurbishment costs** for real estate projects. Only at the end of the project, investors will understand whether it is profitable or not, it may be meaningless to evaluate fund performance midway.

The **Internal rate of return (IRR)** is much more important and appropriate as timing of cash flows is important. This is a better measure of a manager's competency, as the manager makes timing decisions on investments and exits.

> Rank the following infrastructure investments from the lowest risk to the highest risk.
> (1) **ETF which invests in several brownfield infrastructure in the US**
> This is safest as ETF is diversified, infrastructure is already operating with historical performance data, and in a developed country.
> 
> **(2) Direct investment in a brownfield infrastructure in the US**
> This is more risky than (1) as it is in only one infrastructure, so it has a higher concentration risk.
> 
> (3) **MLP that invests in several greenfield infrastructure in emerging markets**
> This is risky as there is construction risk, and it is focused on emerging markets.
> 
> (4) **Shares of a holding company that is embarking on a greenfield infrastructure in a developing country**
> This is more risky than (3) as there is concentration risk.
