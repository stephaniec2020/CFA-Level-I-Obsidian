## Capitalisation vs. expensing long-lived assets
### Long-lived assets
**Long-lived assets/non-current assets** include:
- **tangible assets** - e.g. plant, property and equipment (PP&E), investment property,
- **intangible assets**, including goodwill
- **financial assets**

### Capitalisation and expense
In the initial acquisition of PP&E or other long-lived assets:
- one-off **expense** recorded on **income statement**
- at the same time, the **asset** is **capitalised** on the **balance sheet**

Then, the long-lived asset will either be depreciated or amortised every single year which then will be recorded in the **income statement** and decreasing in value in **balance sheet** over the years. 

The company **should** only:
- **capitalised** (asset on balance sheet) if there is a **future economic benefit**
- **expense** (on income statement) if **future benefit is unlikely or highly uncertain**

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 20.30.30.png]]

### Types of costs to be capitalised
There are several types of costs that can be capitalised:
- Purchase, construction, or manufacturing cost
- Cost necessary to prepare assets for use - e.g. freight, installation, taxes
- Costs that **provide more future benefits** - e.g. upgrades, additional features
- **Interest can also be capitalised (for construction projects**, firms are allowed to capitalise interest costs during construction period)

### Types of costs to be expensed
- Cost that merely sustains the asset's usefulness - e.g. maintenance, repairs

## Impact on financial statements - Financial effects of capitalising vs expensing
There are several measures and financial ratios that will affected by the first year of acquiring the long-lived asset and subsequent years of the long-lived assets.

Some of the points that going to be covered:
- **Net income (first vs. subsequent years)**
- **Income variability**
- **Total assets**
- **Retained earnings**
- **CFI**
- **CFO**
- **Debt ratios**
- **ROA/ROE (first vs. subsequent years)**
- **Interest coverage (first vs. subsequent years)**

### Net income (first vs. subsequent years)
If **capitalised**: 
1. There is **no immediate expense recorded** in the income statement **when a cost is capitalised**. There is zero expense incurred. Without this expense, the net income is higher in the first year if the cost is capitalised, as compared to if it is expensed.
2. In the subsequent periods, the capitalised expenditure is allocated to the income statement through **depreciation expense**. 
If **expensed**:
1. When a cost is expensed, the **entire cost** is recorded immediately in the **income statement**.  
2. If the cost has already been fully expensed there will be no depreciation. As such, the firm that capitalises will report lower net income in the subsequent years.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-26 at 13.40.35.png]]

### Income variability
Only if **capitalised**:
- Capitalising the cost of the asset can potentially result in more stable and consistent income over time. By **spreading the expense over the useful life of the asset**, the impact on **net income is more evenly distributed, reducing income variability (i.e. lower variability of income)**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 20.41.42.png]]

### Total assets 
If **capitalised**:
- Capitalising the cost of the asset **increases the total assets** on the **balance sheet**. The asset's cost is **recorded as a long-term asset**, which adds to the overall value of the company's assets.
If **expensed**:
- No change in the balance sheet

### Retained earnings
If **capitalised**:
- capitalising the cost **increases the value of the asset** on the balance sheet and, **increase retained earnings**
If **expensed**:
- expensing the cost **reduces the net income** and **reduced retained earnings**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 20.42.26.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 20.42.38.png]]

### Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)
If **capitalised**:
- the cash outflow will be **recorded in the initial acquisition year**. In subsequent years, the cash flow from investing activities will not be impacted by the asset acquisition, depreciation is a not cash item, so there will be no effect on cash flow
- Capitalised interest costs are reported as CFI on the statement of cash flows, as they are treated as part of the cost of the constructed capital asset.

### Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)
If **expensed**:
- the cash outflow will be **recorded in the year of expense recognition**, or **it could be recognised in cash flow from operation (CFO)**

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 20.43.29.png]]


### Debt Ratios
If **capitalised**:
- increases the total assets, which may result in a decrease in debt ratios such as the debt-to-assets ratio or the debt-to-equity ratio (i.e. â†“ D/A, â†“ D/E)
If **expensed**:
- the opposite effect (i.e. â†‘ D/A, â†‘ D/E)

### Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) (First vs. Subsequent Years)
If **capitalised**:
1. In the first year, the cost may result in lower ROA and ROE (i.e. â†“ROA, â†“ROE) because the net income is lower due to depreciation or amortisation.
2. In subsequent years, ROA and ROE may be higher (i.e. â†‘ROA, â†‘ROE) compared to expensing as the net income will not be impacted by additional expenses related to the asset (which create an appearance of "improving" ratios).
If **expensed**:
- the opposite effect first year, (i.e. â†‘ROA, â†‘ROE); subsequent years, (i.e. â†“ROA, â†“ROE) 

> Capitalising expenses will increase assets by the capitalised amount, compared with expensing. This will increase both assets and equity and decrease debt-to-equity ratios. If taxes are ignored, net cash flow is unaffected by whether the company expenses or capitalizes costs. If taxes are considered, net cash flow will be lower because capitalisation of costs will increase both net income and taxes payable. Assuming that assets are greater than income, ROA will be higher in the period of capitalisation, compared with expensing.

#### Interest Coverage (First vs. Subsequent Years)
If **capitalised**:
1. In the first year, capitalising the cost may result in a lower interest coverage ratio due to the lower net income. (i.e. â†“ interest coverage ratio)
2. In subsequent years, the interest coverage ratio may improve (i.e. â†‘ interest coverage ratio) as there are no additional expenses related to the capitalised asset apart from depreciation or amortisation (which create an appearance of "improving" ratios). 
If **expensed**:
- the opposite effect first year, (i.e. â†‘ interest coverage ratio); subsequent years, (i.e. â†“ interest coverage ratio)

**Interest coverage ratio** measures the firm's ability to meet its interest obligations and it measures the number of times a company's earning can cover its interest payments:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage\,ratio = \frac{EBIT}{Interest\,payments}}$$
where EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes; â†‘ Interest coverage â‡’ â†‘ Solvency

**Interest coverage** can also be calculated from cash-flow statements:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage = \frac{CFO+Interest\,paid+Taxes\,paid}{Interest\,paid}}$$
measures the firm's ability to meet its interest obligations.
**Note:** If interest paid was classified as a financing activity under IFRS, no interest adjustment is necessary.

## Depreciation methods of PP&E
**Depreciation** is the allocation of cost over an asset's useful life. The original purchase price of the asset is also known as **historical cost**, which includes the installation and transportation cost.

Historical cost - accumulated depreciation = the book value of the asset (a.k.a carrying value, it is the net value of asset on the balance sheet); accumulated depreciation is the real and significant operating expense.

### Modelling for depreciation or amortisation for each period
There are 3 different models for depreciation and amortisation:
- Straight line method
- Accelerated depreciation method - e.g. (Double-decline doubling method)
- Units production method

#### Straight line method
- Straight line of depreciation + residual value that can be sold for at the end of its life
- the economic benefits of its useful life depreciated equally every year
- **assumption**: equal depreciation each year

The **straight-line method equation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Straight\,line\,depreciation\,method = \frac{Cost-Residual\,value}{Useful\,life}}$$
![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.47.11.png]]

#### Accelerated depreciation method
By using the accelerated depreciation method (e.g. double declining balance method),
- **assumption**: generate more benefits in the early years of their economic life; recognises more depreciation expenses in the early years; the depreciation would be the same as straight line method
- e.g. Factory machines working at its 100% efficiency and depreciate in logarithmically/exponential decay (yet to be determined)

The **double declining balance method (DDB)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DDB\,Depreciation = \frac {2}{Useful\,life} \times (Cost-Accumulated\,depreciation)}$$**Note**: !!! where $\mathrm{Cost - Accumulated\,depreciation}$ is also known as the **net book value**, and **depreciation** **stops** **when net book value reaches residual value.**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.47.45.png]]

#### Units-of-production method
**The units of production method**:
- is primarily used to calculate depreciation for assets that are based on their usage or production output. 
- allocates the asset's cost over its estimated total production or usage units. 

The **units-of-production method** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Units\,of\,production \,depreciation=\frac{Output\,units}{Total\,capacity\,in\,units}\times(Cost-Residual\,value)}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 21.00.52.png]]

> An asset was purchased for $40,000 one year ago.  At the point of purchase, the useful life was estimated to be 4 years, with a residual value of $5,000. For the past year, the asset was depreciated using the double declining balance method.
> 
> Going forward, the company decided to raise its residual value to $15,000.
> 
> Calculate the depreciation expense for the second year, using the double declining balance method. $5000
> 
> Depreciation in first yr = 2/4 x $40,000 = $20,000
> Net book value at beginning of 2nd year = $20,000
> Depreciation in second yr = 2/4 x $20,000 = $10,000
> However, since the residual value has been reached, the asset can only be depreciated by $5,000 instead.


### Component method vs. non-component method for PP&E
**Component method** for PP&E are treated differently according to different accounting standards:
- under **IFRS,** entities are **required to apply the component method** for reporting PP&E in certain situations. 
- under US GAAP, the component method is not specifically required for reporting Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E). 

The **component method** involves in **identifying** and **separately recognising** **significant components** of an asset with **different useful lives** or patterns of consumption.

Here's an explanation of the component method and its significance under IFRS:
1. **Recognition of Components**:  The component method requires entities to analyze their PP&E assets and identify significant components that have **different useful lives** or **patterns of consumption**. A **component** refers to **a part of an asset that is separately identifiable** and has a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the asset. **Each significant component is then treated as a separate asset for accounting purposes**. e.g. if a building has separate components such as the roof, HVAC system, and elevators, each component would be accounted for separately.
2. **Depreciation and Amortisation**: Once the components are identified and recognized as separate assets, **depreciation or amortisation is applied to each component** based on its individual useful life. This ensures that the carrying amount of each component is systematically reduced over its respective useful life, reflecting the consumption or wear and tear of that specific component.

The component method provides 4 **significance and benefits** under IFRS:
- **Enhanced Accuracy** - By recognising significant components separately, the financial statements provide more accurate and relevant information about the different assets and their respective depreciation.
- **Transparency**: The component method enhances transparency by providing users of financial statements with detailed information on the significant components of assets and their associated costs.
- **Flexibility** - The component method allows for different components to be treated separately, even if they are part of the same overall asset. This flexibility ensures that the accounting treatment aligns with the actual economic characteristics of the components.
- **Improved Decision-Making** -  With more detailed information on the useful lives and depreciation of individual components, users of financial statements can make more informed decisions regarding the asset's maintenance, replacement, and overall asset management strategies.

## Impact on financial statements - Depreciation methods of PP&E
There are **several measures and financial ratios** that will affected by the **depreciation methods used in PP&E**.

Some of the **financial components/ratios** are affected by **straight line** or **accelerated method**: 
- **Depreciation expense** - (**straight line**: remain constant throughout the useful life; **accelerated**: â†‘ in first year, â†“ in subsequent years)
- **Net income** - (**straight line**: remain constant throughout the useful life; **accelerated**: â†“ in first year, â†‘ in subsequent years)
- **Total assets** - (**straight line** relatively higher in the initial years year **accelerated**)
- **Retained earnings** - (**straight line** relatively higher in the initial years year **accelerated**)
- **Cash flow** - does not affect cash flow as it is a non-cash expense
- **ROA or ROE** - (**straight line** relatively higher in the initial years year **accelerated**)
- **Asset turnover** - (**straight line** relatively lower in the initial years year **accelerated**)

**Asset turnover equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,asset\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,total\,asset}}$$
> Given the higher depreciation expense recorded in the early years under accelerated depreciation methods, total assets will be lower, causing a higher asset turnover ratio versus straight-line.

**Fixed asset turnover ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Fixed\,asset\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,fixed\,asset}}$$
> The use of an accelerated depreciation method will increase depreciation expenses early in the asset's life. The book value of the asset will be lower. Fixed asset turnover ratio (sales/fixed assets) will increase, because the book value of the fixed assets will be lower.

## Accounting principle vs. accounting estimate
### Accounting principle
**Accounting principle** refers to the set of rules and guidelines that govern the preparation and presentation of financial statements. 

**Changes in inventory cost flow method**:
- is considered as a change of accounting principles **(e.g. FIFO to LIFO, or weighted average cost)**
- it requires restatement of prior reporting periods. 

### Accounting estimate
**Accounting estimate** is an approximation of a financial statement element or item that cannot be determined with precision.

Change in depreciation method:
- is considered as change in accounting estimate (e.g. straight line to accelerated, change in salvage value, change in useful life)
- it requires disclosure of the change and apply it prospectively without restatement of prior reporting periods

## Amortisation of intangibles
**Intangible assets** are long-lived assets that lacked physical substance. 

The **intangible** assets can be either:
- **finite** - e.g. patents, copyrights, franchises
- **indefinite** - e.g. brand names, reputation (look out for the word **"nominal fee/minimal cost"**)

For **finite** intangibles, the cost is amortised over useful life. For **indefinite** intangibles, the cost is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, if it has decreased in value, it is written down as a loss in income statement. 

The **intangible assets** can also be defined as:
- **identifiable** - separable from the firm or arise from a contractual or legal right, controlled by the firm, future economic benefits are probable, cost is reliably measurable, all of the items mentioned above are identifiable (e.g. patents, copyrights, franchises, brand names, reputation)
- **unidentifiable** - cannot be purchased separately, may have indefinite life (e.g. goodwill)

**Goodwill** is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business acquisition (accounting goodwill), the acquires are often willing to pay more than the fair value of the target's identifiable net assets because the target may have assets that are not reported on its balance sheet; part of the acquisition price may reflect perceived synergies from business combination. **Goodwill is indefinite-lived, so it is not amortised.**

### Amortisation method
**Amortisation method** is similar to the methods described in depreciation, namely:
- straight-line method
- double-declining straight line method (accelerated decline method)
- the units-of-production method

#### Straight line method equation
The **straight-line method equation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Straight\,line\,depreciation\,method = \frac{Cost-Residual\,value}{Useful\,life}}$$
![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.47.11.png]]

#### Accelerated depreciation method
The **double declining balance method (DDB)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DDB\,Depreciation = \frac {2}{Useful\,life} \times (Cost-Accumulated\,depreciation)}$$ where $\mathrm{Cost - Accumulated\,depreciation}$ is also known as the **net book value**, and depreciation stops when net book value reaches residual value.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.47.45.png]]

#### Units-of-production method
The **units-of-production method** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Units\,of\,production \,depreciation=\frac{Output\,units}{Total\,capacity\,in\,units}\times(Cost-Residual\,value)}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 21.00.52.png]]

#### Summary of the depreciation method equations
![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 21.30.36.png]]

## Accounting treatment for intangible assets
The **intangible asset should be capitalised (i.e. asset on balance sheet) or expensed (i.e. income statement)** differs from the source of the generated intangible asset, which could be:
- whether it is created internally
- purchased externally
- part of business combination

**Intangible asset** should be **capitalised**:
- **R&D** - only development, should be **capitalised under IFRS** - but firm must show that if can complete the asset and intends to use or sell the completed assets
- **Software (for sale)** - both **IFRS** and **US GAAP** *after* feasibility has been established
- **Software (own use)** - **GAAP**, **IFRS only** *after* feasibility has been established
- **Purchased externally (e.g. franchise rights, patents)** - recorded at cost, when purchased as a part of the group, price paid is allocated based on the fair value of each asset
- **Part of business combination (e.g. purchase of subsidiary)** - 
	- acquisition method - sum of identifiable net assets recorded at fair value
	- unidentifiable intangibles (i.e. goodwill) - goodwill = purchase price - sum

**Intangible asset** should be **expensed**:
- **Created internally (e.g. brand name, reputation)** - for both **IFRS** and **US GAAP**
- **R&D** 
	- **IFRS** only research is expensed (development could be capitalised if can be used or sold)
	- **US GAAP** - do not separate research and development, both are expensed 
- **Software (for sale)** - *before* feasibility has been established for both **IFRS** and **US GAAP**
- **Software (own use)** - **IFRS only** *before* feasibility has been established

### Here is the summary for accounting for intangible assets:
![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 21.53.35.png]]

> IndieSoft has been developing a new AI-based spreadsheet software for years, incurring costs of $400,000 in the process.  The software has just passed initial testing, and is being prepared to be publicly tested.  It is expected to have a useful life of 10 years, with no salvage value.  The company has decided that the software is to be amortised yearly using the straight line method.  The company reports under IFRS.
> 
> What is the most likely carrying value of the software 1 year from now? $0
> 
> The $400,000 development cost was incurred before feasibility has been established. This amount should have been expensed.

## Impairments and revaluation
**Impairment** refers to the situation where the **value of an asset declines significantly and permanently**. When an impairment occurs, companies are **required to write down the assets (i.e. reduce the carrying value)**. The treatment **differs based on the type of asset and the reporting standard**.

The method **to write down impairment** differs from the type of the asset:
 - **PP&E**
 - **finite-live intangible assets**
 - **indefinite-live intangible assets**

**Revaluation** in two reporting standards:
- **IFRS** - revaluation gain recognized only to the extent it reverses previously recognised impairment loss, further gains recognised in equity as revaluation surplus (for investment property, all gains and losses from marking to fair value are recognized as income)
- **US GAAP** - revaluation is not permitted

Under the **revaluation** model of **IFRS**, entities have the option to revalue their long-lived assets to their fair value at regular intervals if **there is an active market which can be used to determine the fair value of the assets**.

#### PP&E (IFRS)
The **PP&E impairment** under **IFRS** can use:
- **cost** model
- **revaluation** model
and impairment **should be done at least annually**.

**Cost model of PP&E under IFRS**
The carrying value of **PP&E** equation under **cost model** for PP&E:
$$\mathrm{Carrying\,value=Historical\,cost-Accumulated\,depreciation}$$

To test for **impairment of PP&E** under **IFRS**, the **recoverable amount** is used, which is greater of:
- **fair value** (i.e. selling cost) 
- **value in use** (i.e. PV of future cash flow stream)

If due to impairment, the **new carrying value = recoverable amount**:
- **updated new carrying value (recoverable amount) on the balance sheet**
- **write-down will be in the income statement** as loss.

The amount **can be reversed (i.e. loss reversal) up to the original loss** is allowed under IFRS.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 22.47.34.png]]

**Revaluation model of PP&E under IFRS**
Under the **revaluation** model, **PP&E is reported at fair value minus any accumulated depreciation**. At each revaluation date, the balance sheet value is adjusted to fair value. Between revaluation dates, depreciation is recorded for the asset.

The carrying value equation under **revaluation model** for PP&E:
$$\mathrm{Carrying\,value=Fair\,value-Accumulated\,depreciation}$$

If the asset's **fair value < historical cost**:
- balance sheet will be written as the asset **fair value**
- the **income statement** will be **write-down** as **loss**

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 22.53.52.png]]

If the asset's **fair value** is now revaluated to **historical cost** (subsequent reversals):
- the **balance sheet** would be written down as **fair value**
- the **income statement** can be recognised as **gain** **up to the original loss** 

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 22.54.20.png]]

If the asset's **fair value** is now revaluated *higher than* **historical cost** (subsequent reversals):
- the **balance sheet** would be written down as **fair value**
- **any increase in value above the historical cost is taken to shareholders' equity (OCI)**

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 22.54.39.png]]

### Investment property (IFRS only)
Under PP&E, the **investment property**, property held for rental income and/or capital appreciation is only for **IFRS** and not for **US GAAP**.

The investment property subject to the same **cost model** described above in the PP&E section. However, the **fair value model** is being used instead of **revaluation model**. There is no depreciation in the **fair value** model.

**All investment properties is recorded as gain/loss on income statement**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 23.04.34.png]]

#### PP&E - (US GAAP)
Under **US GAAP**, **only the cost model for PP&E is allowed**, the **revaluation model and loss recoveries are not permitted**.

To test for **impairment of PP&E** under **US GAAP**, the **recoverability test** is used:
- is the carrying value > PV of future ***undiscounted*** cash flow? (requires management discretion)
- if so, there is a **loss recognition** - write down to **fair value** or **discounted value of future cash flow**

![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 21.35.46.png]]

### Finite-live intangible assets
Some of the examples of **finite** intangibles:
- Patents
- Copyrights
- Franchises

#### Finite-live intangible assets (US GAAP)
Under US GAAP, the **cost** model is used for **finite-live intangible assets** and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Carrying\,value=Historical\,cost-Accumulated\,amortisation}$$
**Note:** it is amortisation as it is intangible asset.

To test for **impairment of finite-live intangible assets** under **US GAAP**, the **recoverability test** is used:
- is the carrying value > PV of future ***undiscounted*** cash flow? (requires management discretion)
- if so, there is a **loss recognition** - write down to **fair value** or **discounted value of future cash flow**
![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 21.37.07.png]]

#### Finite-live intangible assets (IFRS)
The carrying value of **finite-live intangible assets** equation under **cost model**:
$$\mathrm{Carrying\,value=Historical\,cost-Accumulated\,amortisation}$$
**Note:** it is amortisation as it is intangible asset.

To test for **impairment of finite-live intangible assets** under **IFRS**, the **recoverable amount** is used, which is greater of:
- **fair value** (i.e. selling cost) 
- **value in use** (i.e. PV of future cash flow stream)

If due to impairment, the **new carrying value = recoverable amount**:
- **updated new carrying value (recoverable amount) on the balance sheet**
- **write-down will be in the income statement** as loss.

Under the **revaluation** model, **finite-live intangible assets is reported at fair value minus any accumulated depreciation**. At each revaluation date, the balance sheet value is adjusted to fair value. Between revaluation dates, depreciation is recorded for the asset.

The carrying value equation under **revaluation model** for **finite-live intangible assets**:
$$\mathrm{Carrying\,value=Fair\,value-Accumulated\,amortisation}$$

If the asset's **fair value < historical cost**:
- balance sheet will be written as the asset **fair value**
- the **income statement** will be **write-down** as **loss**

If the asset's **fair value** is now revaluated to **historical cost** (subsequent reversals):
- the **balance sheet** would be written down as **fair value**
- the **income statement** can be recognised as **gain** **up to the original loss** 

If the asset's **fair value** is now revaluated *higher than* **historical cost** (subsequent reversals):
- the **balance sheet** would be written down as **fair value**
- **any increase in value above the historical cost is taken to shareholders' equity (OCI)**

**Note**: The finite-live intangible assets **can only be used if an active market for the intangible asset exists**.
![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 23.09.44.png]]


### Indefinite-live intangible assets
**Indefinite-live intangible assets** are being accessed every year, and if the carrying value is less than the historical cost, then it is considered impaired, and it should be tested at least annually.

Some of the examples of **indefinite** intangibles:
- Brand names
- Reputation

#### Indefinite-live intangible assets (both IFRS and US GAAP)
The **indefinite-live intangible assets** uses cost model to evaluate the impairment for **both IFRS and US GAAP**:
- the **carrying value = historical cost**

To test for impairment:
- **if carrying value > fair value, an impairment is recognised** 
![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 22.37.15.png]]

### Held-for-sale asset
**Held-for-sale** is a long-lived asset is being reclassified because the management intends to sell it, the asset is no longer depreciated or amortised.

If impaired:
-  the asset is written down to the **net realisable value (NRV)**
- the **loss** is recognized in the **income statement**
- **loss reversals is allowed under both IFRS and US GAAP for held-for-sale asset (limited to the original impairment loss)**

Eventually, held-for-sale assets may be removed from the balance sheet.

## Derecognition
**Derecognition** occurs when assets are:
- **sold**
- **exchanged**
- **abandoned**

When a long-lived asset is sold, the asset is removed from the balance sheet.

Once the asset is **sold**:
- the **sale price** will be **capitalised** on the **balance sheet**
- the **income statement** will recognise the **sales gain/loss**
- the **gain/loss proceeds from sale of long-lived assets** are consider **CFI**.
- the **cash flow statement (CFO)** after sales: (i.e. $\mathrm{Net\,income - Gain/loss\,from\,sales}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 23.12.47.png]]

If the **long-lived asset** is **abandoned**:
- asset is **removed** from the **balance sheet**
- **loss (carrying value)** is recognised in **income statement**
- the **cash flow statement (CFO)** after abandoned: (i.e. $\mathrm{Net\,income - loss\,from\,abandon\,asset}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 22.55.05.png]]

If the **long-lived asset** is **exchanged**:
- update of **new carrying value** from the **balance sheet**
- the **income statement** will recognise the **exchange gain/loss**
- the **cash flow statement (CFO)** after exchanged: (i.e. $\mathrm{Net\,income - Gain/loss\,from\,exchange\,asset}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 23.16.15.png]]

### Summary of exchanging, abandoning, selling the asset

When exchanging one long-lived asset for another, a gain or loss is recorded as the difference between the old asset's carrying value and its fair value (or the fair value of the asset received in exchange, if that value is more evident). When selling an asset, the gain or loss is the difference between the carrying value and the cash received. When abandoning an asset, a firm records a loss equal to the carrying value of the asset.

## Impact on financial statement - Impairments, revaluation, and derecognition
There are 6 aspects of which the **impairment** would affect:
- **Assets**
- **Equity**
- **Net income**
- **Return on assets (ROA)**
- **Return on equity (ROE)**
- **Asset turnover**
and it changes over the **current accounting period** and **subsequent period**.
**Cash flow** is not affected for both **impairment** and recognition as it does not reduce taxable income.

After **impairment**, for the **current accounting period**:
- **Assets** â†“
- **Equity** â†“
- **Net income** â†“
- **Return on assets (ROA)** â†“
- **Return on equity (ROE)** â†“
- **Asset turnover** â†‘

After **impairment**, for the **subsequent accounting period**:
- **Assets** â†“
- **Equity** â†“
- **Net income** â†‘ - higher net income due to lower depreciation expenses
- **Return on assets (ROA)** â†‘ - lower asset based and lower depreciation expenses (i.e. higher future return on assets; $\mathrm{ROA = Net\,income/Total\,assets}$)
- **Return on equity (ROE)** â†‘ - higher net income (i.e. $\mathrm{ROE = Net\,income/Avg.total\,equity}$)
- **Asset turnover** â†‘

Therefore, it is possible to subject to **earnings manipulation** through **impairment**. The new management could decide on **sharp drop in earnings by impairment** attributed to previous management, and increase in the **ROA and ROE** attributed to the new management.

Under **IFRS**, the firm can decide to **revaluate** the **long-lived assets** (gain), and the following would be affected in the **current accounting period**:
- **Assets** â†‘
- **Equity** â†‘
- **Net income** (no change) - since if the long-lived asset is revaluated higher than historical value, it will be recorded into **other comprehensive income (OCI) in stockholders's equity of income statement**
- **Debt ratio** â†“ - due to higher assets and higher equity
- **Debt-to-equity** â†“ - due to higher assets and higher equity

Under **IFRS**, the firm can decide to **revaluate** the **long-lived assets** (gain), and the following would be affected in the **subsequent accounting period**:
- **Assets** â†‘ - higher carrying value
- **Equity** â†‘ - higher carrying value
- **Net income** â†“ - higher depreciation expense (read **note**)
- **Return on assets (ROA)** â†“ - $\mathrm{ROA = Net\,income/Total\,assets}$l; due to the lower net income, the ROA is lower (read **note**)
- **Return on equity (ROE)** â†“ - $\mathrm{ROE = Net\,income/Avg.total\,equity}$; due to the lower net income, the ROE is lower (read **note**)
**Note**: However, if upward revaluation is the result of higher operating capacity, this should result in higher earnings, so the **net income could increase**

## Disclosures of long-lived assets
### Disclosure under IFRS (all long-term asset except investment property)
There are several disclosures under **IFRS** regarding to the **recognition of long-term asset**:
- **Cost model (carrying value)**
	- Basis of measurement of historical cost
	- Useful life of the long-lived asset (**finite or indefinite**)
- **Cost model (impairment)**
	- Reconciliation from beginning to ending values for impairment
	- Write down amount of loss and reversal
	- Where is it recorded in the income statement
	- Circumstances that caused the loss
- **Revaluation model (carrying value)**
	- Cost model carrying value

|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Sales|$21|$23|
|Cost of Goods Sold|(8)|(9)|
|Gross Profit|13|14|
|Cost of Franchise|(6)|0|

|Accounts Payable|$7|$5|
|Long-term Debt|10|5|
|Common Stock|8|8|
|Retained Earnings|6|14|
|Total Liabilities and Equity|$31|$32|

> If Salvo had amortized the cost of the franchise acquired in 20X3 over six years instead of expensing it, Salvo's return on average total equity for 20X4 would have beenÂ _closest_Â to: **31.1%.**
> 
> If the franchise cost had been amortized over six years beginning in 20X3, net income in 20X3 would have been $6 million instead of $1 million due to the cost of franchise expense of $6 million being eliminated and replaced by franchise amortization of $1 million. Net income in 20X4 would have been reduced by the franchise amortization to $7 million instead of $8 million. On the equity side, retained earnings at the end of 20X3 would have been $11 million ($5 million higher), and total equity for 20X3 would have been $8 + $11 = $19 million. Retained earnings for 20X4 would be the 20X3 retained earnings of $11 million increased by 20X4 net income of $7 million for a total of $18 million, and total equity for 20X4 would be $8 + $18 = $26 million. If the franchise cost were amortized, return on total equity for 20X4 would be $7 / ((19 + 26) / 2) = 31.1%.

>Dubois Company bought land for company use five years ago for â‚¬2 million and presents its balance sheet value as â‚¬2.2 million. If the fair value of the land decreases to â‚¬1.8 million, Dubois will:
>recognise a loss of â‚¬200,000 and decrease shareholdersâ€™ equity by â‚¬400,000.
>Because the land is valued above its historical cost on the balance sheet, Dubois is using the revaluation model. The land's revaluation up to â‚¬2.2 million would have been reflected in shareholders' equity with a revaluation surplus of â‚¬200,000. The decrease in fair value to â‚¬1.8 million will reduce the revaluation surplus to zero, and the amount of the write-down below historical cost (â‚¬2 million â€“ â‚¬1.8 million = â‚¬200,000) will be recognized as a loss on Dubois's income statement. This loss, combined with the removal of the revaluation surplus, will decrease shareholders' equity by â‚¬400,000. Note that the land was purchased for company use and therefore would not be classified as investment property.

>
	Item		Amount
Cash payment of dividends	CFF	-$30
Sale of equipment	CFI	+$25
Net income	CFO	+$25
Purchase of land	CFI	-$15
Increase in accounts payable	CFO	+$20
Sale of preferred stock	CFF	+$25
Increase in deferred taxes	CFO	+$5
CFI = Sale of Equipment (+25) + Purchase of Land (â€“15) = $10.

> Selected information from Feder Corp.'s financial activities for the year is as follows:

Net income was $7,650,000.
1,100,000 shares of common stock were outstanding on January 1.
The average market price per share was $62.
Dividends were paid during the year.
The tax rate was 40%.
10,000 shares of 6% $1,000 par value preferred shares convertible into common shares at a rate of 20 common shares for each preferred share were outstanding for the entire year.
70,000 options, which allow the holder to purchase 10 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $50 per common share, were outstanding the entire year.
Feder Corp.'s diluted earnings per share (EPS) was closest to:

Feder's basic earnings per share ((net income â€“ preferred dividends) / weighted average shares outstanding) was (($7,650,000 â€“ ($1,000 Ã— 10,000 Ã— 0.06)) / 1,100,000 =) $6.41.

If the convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock at January 1, (10,000 Ã— 20 =) 200,000 additional common shares would have been issued, dividends on the preferred stock would not have been paid, and Diluted EPS would have been ($7,650,000 / (1,100,000 + 200,000) = $5.88. Because $5.88 is less than basic EPS of $6.41, the preferred shares are dilutive.

Using the treasury stock method, if the options were exercised cash inflow would be (70,000 Ã— 10 Ã— $50 =) $35,000,000. The number of Feder shares that can be purchased with the inflow (cash inflow divided by the average share price) is ($35,000,000 / $62 =) 564,516.

The number of shares that would have been created is (700,000 â€“ 564,516 =) 135,484. Diluted EPS was [($7,650,000 â€“ ($1,000 Ã— 10,000 Ã— 0.06)] / (1,100,000 + 135,484) =) $5.71. Because this is less than the EPS of $6.41, the options are dilutive.

Combining the calculations, Diluted EPS was (($7,650,000) / (1,100,000 + 200,000 + 135,484) = $5.32.
