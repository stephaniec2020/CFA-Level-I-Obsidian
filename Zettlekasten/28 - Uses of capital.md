## Capital budgeting
**Capital budgeting** is a process where identifying and evaluating capital projects where the cash flow will be received for > 1 year. 

### Uses of capital budgeting
Capital budgeting is important as it is costly and determine the future success of the firm. Any **corporate decisions** can be decided from this capital budgeting framework. 
This can be used for:
- acquiring new assets
- replacement of assets
- expansion of business
- even restructure the whole company. 

The working capital management and strategic M&A, ultimately the capital budget should **maximise the shareholder values** and increase share values.

### Capital budgeting process
The capital budgeting process can be summarised into 4 key steps:
**1. Generate good project ideas** - it can be top-down, bottom-up, from certain department, or externally
**2. Analyse individual proposals** - which includes gathering information, forecasted cash flows/profitability for each project
**3. Create a firm-wide capital budget** - firms must prioritise according to the timing of the **cash flows**, available company **resources**, and the company's overall **strategy**, it is when the time of company decide to embark on the project or to reject the proposals
**4. Monitor projects and conduct post-audits** - actual results are compared with predicted results, and the differences must be explained â‡’ as it identify the systematic errors in the forecasting process and helps improve business operations, and in turn, produce concrete ideas for future investments

### Categories of capital projects
There are 5 categories of capital projects:
- **Replacement projects** 
	- To maintain business operation - normally conducted without detailed analysis
	- For cost reduction purposes - detailed analysis is required
- **Expansion projects**
	- Building an extended part of current plant - complete decision making process as it requires to project future's demand
	- Building a new plant - complete decision making process as it requires to project future's demand
- **New product/market**
	- New product or market - complete decision making process as it requires to project future's demand
- **Mandatory projects**
	- Mandatory projects maybe required by regulators or insurance companies, normally safety related or with environmental concerns
- **Other projects**
	- Not easily analysed through the capital budgeting process (e.g. pet project of senior management, high risk R&D project)

## Basic principles of capital budgeting

### Conventions
Our convention is that all outflows of cash from a firm or investor to a project is using the negative sign, and the arrows should point towards the timeline. All inflows of cash from the project to the investor are of positive sign and the arrows should point away from the timeline.

### Principles in capital budgeting
There are 5 key principals in capital budgeting:
1. Decisions are based on **cash flows** (i.e. actual cash put into/received from a project), **not accounting income** (i.e. net income, takes into account of non-cash items like depreciation and amortisation) - ignore intangible costs/benefits
2. Cash flows should take into account **opportunity costs** (cash flows that a firm will lose by undertaking the project) - **incremental cash flow approach** (i.e. projected cash flow subtract the one that is not taken)
3. **Timing** of the cash flows is important (i.e. cash flows received earlier are worth more)
4. Cash flows are analysed on an **after-tax** basis (as cash that goes to the government does not increase the firm value)
5. Ignore **financing costs** (e.g. interest on debt) - discount rate already takes into account the firm's **cost of capital**

### Terminology
**Conventional cash flow** - means the signs on the cash flows changes *only once*
**Unconventional cash flow** - means the signs on the cash flows can change *more than once*
**Sunk cost** - cost that cannot be avoided, even if the project is not undertaken (**Do not include in capital budgeting analysis**), already expensed and is regarded as sunk cost
**Externalities** - effects the acceptance of a project may have on other firm cash flows
**Negative externalities** - Cannibalisation, when a new project takes sales from an existing product - e.g. introduction of the new machine could take away sales from the coffee vending machine
**Positive externalities** - e.g. snack vending machine next to the drinks vending machine
Factor in externalities when evaluating a new project

### Basic concepts for project evaluation
**Independent** - If the projects are unrelated to each other, then one can choose both
**Mutually exclusive** - Projects compete directly with each other, can only choose one, depending on which project is more profitable
**Project sequencing** - some projects must be undertaken in a certain order, investing in a project creates **opportunity** to invest in other projects in the future
**Unlimited funds** - With unlimited access to capital, it can undertake all profitable projects
**Capital rationing** - Constraints on the amount of capital it can raise, the firm must prioritise to achieve maximum shareholder value

## Investment decision criteria
The **investment decision criteria** are mostly based on the two most common methods:
- **Net present value (NPV)**
- **Internal rate of return (IRR)**
to evaluate capital investments.

### Net present value (NPV)
**Net present value** is the sum of the present value of all the expected incremental cash flows.
(i.e. sum of the PV of all the expected cash flows)

**Discount rate** (also known as the required rate of return) used is the firm's cost of capital adjusted for the risk level of the project. The required rate of return is normally the firm finance at that borrowing cost (in %).

For a normal project, the **net present value equation of a project** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{NPV=\sum PV(Expected\,inflows)-Initial\,cost}$$
The NPV can be viewed as the expected effect on shareholder wealth. When the capital investment NPV is positive, shareholder wealth is expected to increase. The company should not invest in this project if the NPV of the project is negative, as the effect to the shareholder wealth is negative.

### Internal rate of return (IRR)
The **Internal rate of return (IRR)** is the discount rate for which the NPV of the project is equal to zero.

This implies that for firms which are able to raise a capital at a rate lower than the IRR, the NPV will be positive and the firms should accept the project. (i.e. Cost of capital < IRR â‡’ Accept project)

For firms whose cost of capital is higher than the project's IRR, the NPV to the firm is negative,
and the firm should reject the project.  (i.e. Cost of capital > IRR â‡’ Reject project)

Remember to use CLR WORK before inputting CF
On the calculator: $CF_0$: initial investment, C01: cash inflow at period 1, F01: frequency of C01.
For I/Y=cost of capital e.g. 25%; key in 25.

### NPV vs IRR method

#### Conflicted outcome of using NPV vs IRR
![[Screenshot 2023-05-11 at 19.41.52.png]]

**The general rule** is when projects are mutually exclusive, accept a project that has the highest NPV, and if it's greater than zero. If projects are not mutually exclusive, accept all projects that are profitable in which either method will give you the same outcome.

### NPV and share price
**NPV** can be viewed as the amount that will be added to **shareholders' wealth** when **the project is undertaken and the cash flows are received as expected**. A project with positive NPV will increase the value of the firm to the shareholders and it should be accepted. **In theory,** a positive **NPV project should cause a proportionate increase in a company's stock price**.

**In reality**, the actual impact is more complicated. A company's stock price is more a function of its **expected future investments** and this comes with an expectation on the profitability of its future projects. If the company announces a new project with positive NPV but the expected profitability of the project comes in short of expectations, the share price is likely to fall.

**Note**: stock price is related to people's expectation.

As another example, the project announcement may be taken as a **signal about other future capital projects**. If **expectations are raised**, the increase in stock price may be much greater than what the NPV of the announced project would justify.

### ROIC and impact on share price
**Return on invested capital ratio (ROIC)** is a measure of the profitability of a company relative to the amount of capital invested by the equity and debt holders, which is related to the stock price.

The equation of **return on invested capital (ROIC)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROIC=\frac{After\,tax\,net\,profit}{Avg.\,book\,value\,of\,invested\,capital}}$$
where average book value of invested capital: debt + preferred stock + common stock.

The **cost of capital (COC)** is the required return of to the investor, which is also related to the 

## Common pitfalls in capital budgeting
There are some of the **common pitfalls in capital budgeting**:
- Failing to incorporate economic responses 
- Misusing standardised templates
- Pet projects of senior managements
- Decisions based on EPS or ROE
- Basing decisions on IRR
- Inaccurate estimates of future cash flows
- Using incorrect discount rates (has to be the project risk, it is not the weighted average cost of capital) when estimating the NPV of the project
- Politics involved with spending the entire capital budget
- Failure to consider alternative investment ideas
- Improper handling of sunk costs and opportunity costs

#### Failing to incorporate economic responses
- For example, if there's an lucrative economic opportunity with low barriers of entry, the competitors might actually fight and get into the industry at the same time and lowering the profitability, cash flow may not be as high as anticipated due to increased competition

#### Misusing standardised templates
- However, it may not be an exact match for all projects. It might ended up with estimation errors.

#### Pet projects of senior managements ðŸ‘¥
- Some overly optimistic projections

#### Decisions based on EPS or ROE
- Project A vs Project B - may affect company's EPS and ROE in short term
- Project A - higher NPV, but unprofitable in short-term, Project B - lower NPV, but profitable in the short term, the management may decide on Project B as the compensation is tied to the EPS and ROE

#### Basing decisions on IRR

Conflicting project rankings
Some might decide to prioritise on IRR than NPV, correct approach is to prioritise NPV as it maximises shareholder's wealth

#### Inaccurate estimates of future cash flows
- For a complex project, it's easy to double count or fail to include certain cash flows in the analysis.
- Another key mistake is underestimating or overestimating the effects of inflation.
- Overhead costs may also get misestimated as they are often difficult to quantify.
- Over or underestimation of cash flows can lead to incorrect investment decisions.

#### Using incorrect discount rates 
- The project should reflect the project's risk. Simply using the company's WACC as a discount rate without adjusting it for the risk of the project may lead to significant errors when estimating the NPV of a project.

(has to be the project risk, it is not the weighted average cost of capital) when estimating the NPV of the project

Under/over estimate effects of inflation

#### Politics involved with spending the entire capital budget
Some managers will spend all of their budget and argue that their budget is too small, so as to justify for a budget increase in the following year. Ideally, managers should return excess funds to shareholders whenever there is a lack of positive NPV projects or save the cash for future crisis and opportunities.

#### Failure to consider alternative investment ideas
- Management might sometimes fail to consider ideas outside of the box.

#### Improper handling of sunk costs and opportunity costs
- Managers often find it difficult to ignore sunk costs, (paid for consultation or so on), however the economic alternatives are often missed as they may not be that apparent, there are so many alternatives the managers have not considered.

> Vanilla Corp invested $100,000 into a building project, In addition, the firm paid $6,000 to a consultation firm to evaluate the project, and $4,000 in fees to a broker who helped to procure the land. What is the initial cost of the project from a capital budgeting perspective? Â **$104,000**
> 
> $6,000 consultation fee is a sunk cost that cannot be recovered even if the project is not undertaken. Sunk costs should not be included in a capital budgeting analysis.
> 
> $4,000 fee to the broker to buy the land is NOT a sunk cost as it is paid only if the project is undertaken. It should therefore be part of the initial cost of the project.

## Real options
**Real options** allow managers to make future decisions that change the value of capital budgeting decisions made today.

Real options allow managers to make future decisions that change the value of capital budgeting decisions made today.

Real options are similar to financial call and put options, in that they give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to make a decision in the future.

The difference is that real options are based on real assets, rather than financial assets and are contingent on future events. Real options offer managers flexibility that can improve the NPV estimates for individual projects.

### Types of real options
There are different types of real options:
- **Timing options** - allows the manager to delay making an investment with the hope of having better information in the future that might improve the NPV.
- **Sizing options** - allows the manager to resize the project sometime in the future.
	- **Abandonment options** -  similar to put options as they allow management to abandon a project if the present value of the incremental cash flows from exiting a project exceeds the present value of the incremental cash flows from continuing a project (i.e. PV(Salvage value) > PV(future cash flow)).
	- **Expansion options** - similar to call option, make additional investments to scale up the project
- **Flexibility options** - gives the manager choices regarding the operational aspect of a project after it is commenced. 
	- **Price setting options** - e.g. if demand > capacity, price setting options allows the manager to increase the price of the product. This allows the company to increase future cash flows without increasing production.
	- **Production-flexibility options** - if demand > capacity, negotiate with workers to work overtime and switch production
- **Fundamental option** - entire project is an option, the payoff depends on the price of the underlying project

### Evaluating projects with real options
There are a number of ways to evaluate the value of projects with real options:
- Determine the NPV of the project without the option (as the assumption of real options have positive values)
- **NPV of the project (without option) + estimated value of option value - option cost** (net estimated value)
- Decision trees
- Option pricing models
