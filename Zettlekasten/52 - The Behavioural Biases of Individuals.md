## Cognitive errors
### Introduction to cognitive errors
Traditional finance theory like the **efficient market hypothesis (EMH)** assumes that:
- individuals act as perfectly rational economic beings
- objectively consider all relevant information to make rational decisions in the markets

If all market participants are rational, markets will be perfectly priced. So investors cannot make abnormal profit from markets.

Research has demonstrated that when people face complex decisions, they often rely on **basic judgments and preferences** to simplify the situation rather than acting completely rationally, thus **making biased decisions**.

**Behavioural finance**, studying the biases of market participants, one can better explain the perceived anomalies in the market that seem to deviate from the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).

### Behavioural finance
The behavioural finance have 2 major sub-categories and within those have many biases:
- **Cognitive errors** - faulty reasoning or irrationality
	- **Belief perseverance** - irrational reluctance to change prior beliefs and decisions
		- **Conservatism bias** - tendency to maintain existing beliefs and not update them sufficiently
		- **Confirmation bias** - seeking or interpreting information in a way that confirms existing beliefs
		- **Representative bias** - making judgments based on stereotypes or generalisations
		- **Illusion of control bias** - overestimating one's ability to control outcomes
		- **Hindsight bias** - believing that an event was more predictable after it has occurred
	- **Processing errors** - information analysis is flawed
		- **Anchoring bias** - relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered
		- **Mental accounting bias** - treating money differently based on its source or intended use
		- **Framing bias** - being influenced by the way information is presented or framed.
		- **Availability bias** - overestimating the likelihood of events based on their ease of recall
- **Emotional biases** - feelings, impulses, intuition - more difficult to overcome
	- **Loss aversion bias** - the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains
	- **Overconfidence bias** - having excessive confidence in one's own abilities or judgments
	- **Self-control bias** - failing to act in line with long-term goals due to short-term impulses
	- **Status Quo bias** - preferring to maintain the current state of affairs
	- **Endowment bias** - overvaluing items simply because one owns them
	- **Regret aversion bias** - avoiding actions that may lead to regret, even if it may be beneficial.

### Belief perseverance
**Belief perseverance** which is a form of cognitive error that is, it's due to faulty reasoning or rationality. Psychologists use the term **cognitive dissonance** to describe a situation where an individual holds a particular belief, but is aware of information that contradicts the belief to reduce the stress caused. By cognitive dissonance, he may discount the conflicting information by questioning the truth, source applicability or significance. This is a reflection of bias in favour of currently held beliefs.

There are different types of **belief perseverance**:
- **Conservatism bias**
- **Confirmation bias**
- **Representative bias**
- **Illusion of control bias**
- **Hindsight bias**

#### Conservatism bias
**Conservatism bias** is when market participants rationally form an initial view, but then **fail to change that view as new information becomes available**.

Several traits of conservatism bias:
- it means that the investor has a tendency to conserve his or her prevailing belief
- being slow to react to new information that may contradict the belief
- holding investments **too long** (unwilling or slow to update a view or forecast)

Reason behind conservatism bias:
- **avoiding the mental effort** or stress of updating prior beliefs by not considering the implications

e.g. an investor may persist in his belief of allocating 80% of his portfolio to equities as he persists in his belief that equities always outperform bonds. This could be in spite of reports that equities are grossly overvalued. The odds of a recession are much higher.

### Confirmation bias
**Confirmation bias** occurs when market participants **focus on or seek information** that supports prior beliefs while **avoiding** or diminishing the importance of **conflicting information or viewpoints**.

Several traits of confirmation bias:
- distort new information in a way that remains consistent with their prior beliefs
- may cause market participants to become overconfident about the correctness of their belief

To mitigate confirmation bias:
- should seek out contrary views and information (e.g. reading analyses and viewpoints that disagree with a presently held belief, rather than only reading those that reinforce the belief)

e.g. an investor who has invested heavily in energy stocks may seek out articles and viewpoints that are bullish on the energy sector while avoiding or dismissing the many more articles that are bearish on energy

### Representative bias
**Representativeness bias** is the tendency to make **premature conclusions based on flawed assumptions** (i.e. classification reflex), which may or may not be accurate depending on the situation. One form of representativeness is **base-rate neglect**.

There are several types of representative biases:
- **Base-rate neglect** - 
- **Sample size neglect**

#### Base-rate neglect
To illustrate this, consider a random person whom you pick from the street and found out that he has been infected by a severe respiratory virus.

Given that the unvaccinated are twice as likely to get infected than the vaccinated. Do you think this person is more likely vaccinated or unvaccinated against the disease?

Well, you would probably jump to conclude that the person is more likely unvaccinated.

Considering evidence that suggests the unvaccinated are more likely to get infected than the vaccinated. However, one flaw with this reasoning is that it fails to consider the infection statistics of the larger population.

e.g., if 8 in 10 of the population have been vaccinated and if the chances of unvaccinated getting infected is one in two but one in four for the vaccinated, this infected person in this population is in fact two times more likely to be vaccinated.

This example illustrates base rate neglect, where the base rate, which in this case is the incidence rate in the larger population, is neglected in favour of specific information, which is evidence that the unvaccinated are more likely to get infected.

If we apply this bias to financial markets:
e.g. it could be that an individual is so concerned whether an individual company will default on its debt instead of seeing it from the perspective of the industry performance, which is the base rate that is, if the industry as a whole is doing very well and there has been no default for the past 10 years, chances of the particular company defaulting may be very low.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 18.52.07.png]]


#### Sample-size neglect
**Sample size neglect** refers to **making conclusions based on a small and potentially unrealistic data sample**.

The bias is in concluding that the sample reflects the characteristics of the population.
e.g. a fund manager may show strong performance over a three year time horizon. This may lead investors to assume that this is evidence of superior skill. However, examination of longer sample periods may show a lack of persistence, which the investor may have ignored, the evidence of the lack of persistence of managers relative performance over time does not support investors conclusion that this manager will continue to outperform.

### Illusion of control bias
**Illusion of control bias** is characterised by market participants who **tend to believe that they can control or influence outcomes when in fact they cannot**.

Such individuals with illusion of control bias may:
- infer causal connections (where none existed) - e.g. stocks always rise when the president tweets
- display surprisingly great certainty in their predictions - e.g. energy will double in 12 months

As a result, investors with illusion of control bias:
- have **inadequately diversified** portfolios (inclined to bet large amounts on investments that they think they have control over)
- construction financial models and forecasts that are **overly detailed** (believing that forecasts from such models can control uncertainty)
- often associated with emotional biases like overconfidence

### Â Hindsight bias
**Hindsight bias** is where market participants have the **tendency to believe that past events were in fact quite predictable**.

This stems from the psychology that people tend to **remember what they predicted correctly** **more than** **what they predicted wrongly**.

As a result, investors with hindsight bias:
- **Overconfidence** (take on more risk)
- **Unfair assessment** on investment managers (blame managers for not being able to predict certain outcomes)

### Information-processing biases
**Information-processing biases** are caused more by **illogical or irrational processing of information** rather than the decision making process.

There are several types of **information-processing biases**:
- **Anchoring bias** - "anchoring and adjustment bias"
- **Mental accounting bias**
- **Framing bias**
- **Availability bias**

### Anchoring bias
**Anchoring and adjustment bias** refers to basing expectations on the prior number and overweighting its importance, making adjustments in relation to that number when new information arrives. Also, it is similar to **conservatism bias**, which is downplay the new information persist in current belief.

e.g. Imagine you decide to buy a stock which is trading at $100. For some reason, you decide to delay the purchase to tomorrow. The next day, the company announced a major contract win and the stock price jumps to $120. In the end, you decide not to buy, as you could have gotten it yesterday for $100. In this case, the anchor is at $100, to cause ignoring or underestimating the new information of a contract win on the stock price.

### Mental accounting bias
**Mental accounting bias** refers to **viewing money in different accounts or from different sources differently when making investment decisions**.

This is in conflict with the idea that investment decisions should be made in the context of the investor's **overall** portfolio of assets based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.

e.g. if someone won a lottery and decides to invest all of the winnings to highly risky cryptocurrency. investments instead of considering the money as part of his overall investment portfolio, his rationale is that the lottery winnings is extra money so he can afford to lose it all.

According to portfolio theory, he should have considered the winnings as part of his overall portfolio and allocate a portion to cryptocurrencies if he has the increased risk tolerance for it.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 15.45.18.png]]

e.g2. Another a scenario you may more readily identify with. How many times have you held on to a stock just because the price is lower than what you've paid for? This is another example of mental accounting bias because you should be making investment decisions from the portfolio perspective. If the stock no longer has a place in your portfolio, you should sell it regardless of whether you've made a profit or loss. This is also an example of **anchoring bias**, where your anchor is the price that you bought the stock at.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 15.46.02.png]]

### Framing bias 
**Framing bias** is an information processing bias in which a person answers a question differently based on the way in which it is asked or framed.

e.g. if a prospective investor of a PE fund is given a marketing material that frames the success rate on a loss context, the investor may reject the proposal, but if it's framed in a gain context, the investor may be more inclined to accept.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 15.51.43.png]]

e.g2. Investment managers must also take care to avoid framing bias when creating questions to assess an investor's risk tolerance. Failing to properly assess risk tolerance may identify investors as more or less risk averse than they actually are resulting in portfolios that are inconsistent with the investor's needs.


e.g3. an investor might focus solely on short term fluctuations in a firm stock price overlooking or even dismissing other important properties such as its business model, fundamental performance and valuation.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 15.51.58.png]]
### Availability bias
**Availability bias** refers to putting **undue emphasis on information that's readily available**, **easy to recall** or based narrowly on **personal experience** or knowledge in financial markets.

e.g. Investors are familiar with broad classifications of stocks and bonds, so their investment universe may simply be a mix of such securities.

e.g2. Some investors may also just stick with the big names, thus further limiting their investment universe.

e.g3. Another manifestation of availability bias is in the realm of choosing funds or investment advisers. Some investors may just go with the ones that they can recall from advertisements rather than choosing one that is a good fit based on his or her objectives and risk profile.

Failure to diversify is also an issue for an investor who works in a particular industry so he may invest too much into the sector.

## Emotional biases
**Emotional biases** differ from cognitive biases and that they stem from **unconscious emotions** rather than from a lack of understanding or gaps in knowledge. Unlike cognitive biases which can be corrected through education. **Emotions are much harder to correct** as **individuals may be unwilling or unable to control their feelings**.

There are 6 main types of emotional biases:
- **Loss aversion bias**
- **Overconfidence bias**
- **Self-control bias**
- **Status Quo bias** - result in inaction due to inertia
- **Endowment bias** - result in inaction due to attaching extra value to what is owned
- **Regret aversion bias** - result in inaction due to fear of making wrong choices

### Loss aversion bias
**Loss aversion** arises from **feeling more pain from a loss than pleasure** from an equal gain in magnitude. (i.e. If an investor loses $10, he would feel much more anguish than the joy he would have if he gained $10.) 

#### Loss aversion bias study - Kahneman and Tversky 
e.g. In one scenario, you are given $10 and you have a choice to either receive an additional $5 with certainty or to flip a coin and win an additional $10 if it lands, heads up or nothing if it lands, tails up. What would you choose?

In a second scenario, you were given $20 and you have a choice to either take $5 loss with certainty or flip a coin and lose nothing if it lands heads up but lose $10 if it lands tails up, what would you choose in this case?

Now, if you study all the options rationally, the expected value of your wealth is $15 for every scenario and every option. So **a rational investor would be indifferent to either choice in either scenario**.

However, in a study conducted by Kahneman (Daniel Kahneman) and Tversky in 1973, most participants chose the **riskless option in scenario one, which is to receive an additional $5**.

However, most participants chose the risky option in scenario two, which is to **flip the coin for the chance to avoid losing**.

This study **concludes that individuals display asymmetric responses to gains and losses** relative to a reference in scenario one. The reference is the $10 initially given to the individual. The individual **perceives the choices as a gain with reference to the initial $10 an individual's preferred not to take risk when faced with gains**.

In scenario two, the reference is $20. So the individual perceives the choices presented as a loss with reference to the initial $20 when faced with potential loss. **The individual is willing to take risk in the hope of avoiding a loss**.

### Implication of loss aversion in financial market
In financial markets, consequences of loss aversion bias may include:
- **selling to avoid a loss**
	- may result in overtrading
	- increases transaction costs
	- decreases returns
- **incurring too much risk by continuing to hold onto assets** just because they are lower than cost (even if the asset has lost its fundamental value)

Be very clear that **loss aversion $\ne$ avoids risk**. Rather, it means that the investor has a **tendency to avoid losing in extreme cases**. An investor who has a losing position **may take on more risk in the hope of recovering the earlier losses**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 16.10.51.png|500]]

### Overconfidence bias
**Overconfidence** is when an individual tends to overestimate his own intuitive ability or reasoning. While overconfidence is both cognitive and emotional, it is more emotional in nature because the bias primarily results from emotion.

Overconfidence may be **intensified** when combined with **self attribution bias**:
- take too much credit for successes
- assign blame to others for failures

There are 2 forms of overconfidence bias:
- **Prediction overconfidence** - underestimate uncertainty and standard deviation of predictions
- **Certainty overconfidence** - overstate the probability of being right

As a result, investors with overconfidence:
- underestimate risk
- overestimate return
- fail to diversify sufficiently

### Self-control bias
**Self-control bias** occurs when **individuals lack self-discipline and favour short term satisfaction over long term goals**.

Rational behaviour suggests that people would do whatever is necessary to achieve their long term goals, but most often does not happen. **Hyperbolic discounting** is when individuals may favour small pay offs now at the expense of larger pay offs in the future .

In financial markets, self-control bias may result in:
- overemphasis on income-producing assets to meet short term needs in the longer term
- insufficient savings to fund retirement needs
- in turn may cause an investor to take excessive risk later in their lives to try to compensate for insufficient savings accumulation.

Self-control bias might be mitigated by:
- establishing an appropriate investment plan
- a budget to achieve sufficient savings
Both should be reviewed on a regular basis.

### Status quo bias
**Status quo bias** is an emotional bias that occurs when **comfort with an existing situation causes an individual to do nothing to change**, even when change is warranted in making investment choices, market participants may favour the option to **maintain** existing investments or allocations. Organisations may sometimes take advantage of status quo bias by making the default choice that they wish for the individual to take up.

Consequences of **status quo bias** may include:
- holding portfolios with inappropriate risk
- not considering other better investment alternatives

### Endowment bias
**Endowment bias** occurs when an asset is perceived as special and more valuable simply because it's **already owned** and **has special meaning to the holder**. Ownership "endows" the asset with added value.

e.g. the spouse may hold on to securities the deceased spouse purchased for reasons like sentiment that are unrelated to the current merits of the securities.

One simple way to detect endowment bias is to ask the holder the minimum price that it would be willing to sell the asset today and the maximum price it would be willing to buy the same asset today.

For a rational investor, these two amounts should be the same, however, many individuals tend to state a higher price for selling an asset than the price they're willing to buy once they own an asset. **They act as if it is worth more than what they would pay.** This is irrational behaviour.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 16.54.23.png]]

Market participants who exhibit endowment bias may be:
- **failing to sell assets** that are **no longer appropriate** for their investment needs
- they hold assets with which they are familiar because they provide some **intangible sense of comfort**
- maintain an **inappropriate asset allocation** that's inconsistent with his or her risk tolerance and goals.

### Regret aversion bias 
**Regret aversion bias** occurs when market participants **do nothing out of excessive fear** that actions could go wrong.

They attach overweight to **errors of commission** that is **doing something that turns out wrong** and **underweight to errors of omission** that is **not doing something that would have turned out right**.

e.g. One classic example is individuals who retain most of their wealth in bank savings. **Errors of commission**: so afraid that the market will crash that they avoid the stock market, **Errors of omission**: underplay the strong likelihood that inflation will erode the value of their savings. **Their sense of regret and pain is stronger for errors of commission.**

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 16.54.44.png]]

**Herding** is where participants go with the consensus or popular opinion. Participants tell themselves they're not to blame if others are wrong too.

In financial markets, consequences of regret aversion bias may include:
- **excess conservatism in the portfolio** because riskier assets tend to get lots of bad press when they perform poorly.
- avoid riskier assets for they wish to avoid potential regret of investing in the wrong, risky assets.

## The behavioural biases of individuals
### How behavioural finance influences market behaviour

Under the **efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**, markets have priced in risk perfectly, therefore, abnormal profits from trading the market are not possible.

However, various perceived market anomalies, which are patterns that do not fit the prevailing model of securities risks and returns and market inefficiencies, anomalies that present opportunities to earn abnormal profits.

Many market anomalies are being explained by:
- **Patterns that do not fit the prevailing risk models** â‡’ small sample size, time, period bias or inadequacies of prevailing models of returns
- **Market inefficiencies** â‡’ misspecification of risk, leading to inaccurate risk adjustment of returns.

There remain points made unconvinced that the efficient market hypothesis exist, anomalies like :
- **Momentum effect**
- **Bubbles and crashes in markets**
- **Outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks**

Let's study how each of these may be explained by the behavioural biases of individuals.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 17.05.21.png]]

### Momentum/trend effect
Studies have documented **momentum or trending effects** in which future price behaviour exhibits positive correlation with that of the recent past.

The trend typically lasts for several years before showing a reversal.

Momentum can be partly explained by:
- **Availability bias** - reason based on **recent** experience, tend to recall recent events more vividly and give them undue weight in such models (e.g. if the price of an asset rises for a period of time, investors may simply extrapolate this rise to the future)
- **Hindsight bias** - regret is the feeling that an opportunity is being missed, which reflects the human tendency to perceive past events as having been predictable (e.g. Faced with regret from not owning the stock when it performed well in the past, investors may be driven to remedy this regret.)

Both these behavioural factors can result in stock rallies that persist for extended periods of time and contribute to over trading in the stock.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 17.13.04.png]]

### Market bubbles and crashes
**Asset bubbles and crashes** have always been evident in trading markets and their existence presents a challenge to the concept of market efficiency. However, some bubbles may have rational explanations.

Rational investors may:
- be very well aware that a market is in a bubble, but choose to **rationally** stay invested as the possibility or timing of a future crash may not be predictable.
- lose out more if he exits the investment too early
- not have effective short opportunities in a bull market because of the cost of selling short
- unwillingness of investors to bear extended losses
- simply the unavailability of suitable instruments

These factors were considerations in past technology and real estate bubbles.

Other biases during bubbles and crashes can be identified in the **bull market (bubbles)**:
- **Overconfidence** - e.g. overtrading, underestimate risk, lack of diversification
	- linked to **hindsight bias** -  can fuel overconfidence as investors give themselves credit for choosing profitable wins
	- linked to **confirmation bias** - may cause investors to ignore or misinterpret new information that contradicts their belief in the stock's future performance or to misinterpret initial decreases in asset values as simply another buying opportunity.
- **Regret aversion bias** - can also encourage investors to participate in a bubble, believing they are missing out on profit opportunities of the asset prices soar.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 17.19.07.png]]

During the stage of early stage of bear market, there are these types of biases:
- **Anchoring bias** - some markets may under react because of anchoring, where they continue to believe that the recent highs confirm the value of the asset and that the price will eventually return to those levels (Such investors may be in **cognitive dissonance** as they **ignore losses and attempt to rationalize higher prices**)
- 
Eventually, investors capitulate as the price plunges, which further accelerates the decline.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 17.25.05.png]]

### Outperformance of value stocks vs. growth stocks
The outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks has been an anomaly that has persisted on a long term basis. In general, **value stocks** are those with **low P/E and a high dividend yield**. 

Some researchers have attributed the extra returns to additional risks in growth stocks. If adjusted for firm size and book-to-market ratios, the long-term return of growth stocks should be comparable.

There are several proposed biases for having outperformance of value vs. growth stock:
- "The halo effect" is a version of **representativeness bias** in which a company's good characteristics, **fast growth** and a **rising stock price**, are extended into a conclusion that it is a good stock to own â‡’ overvaluation of growth stocks and hence their long term underperformance against value stocks.
- **Overconfidence bias** - in predicting growth rates, potentially leading growth stocks to be overvalued.
- **Availability bias** - Another aspect of the halo effect is that investors tend to invest heavily in firms they have an emotional attachment to or firms whose products they use or those that have memorable marketing messages. Such firms are more likely to be growth stocks, which may have flashier products and higher marketing budgets.

#### Home bias anomaly 
The **home bias anomaly** is where investors invest heavily in their domestic companies in a global portfolio. 

Home bias may result from: 
- a belief that they have better access to information
- simply an emotional desire to invest in companies closer to home

This goes against rationality, which suggests greater diversification to reduce portfolio risk.
