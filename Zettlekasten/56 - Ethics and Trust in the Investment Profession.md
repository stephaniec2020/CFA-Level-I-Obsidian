## Importance of ethics
### Definition of ethics
Ethics is a set of shared beliefs about good/acceptable and bad/unacceptable behaviour.

Ethical conduct is behaviour that:
- follows moral principles
- balances your self-interest with the impact on others
- regarded as beneficial actions by society - where beneficial actions if it improves the outcomes or consequences for stakeholders (e.g. clients, coworkers, employers, investment professional)
- deny personal benefit and placing stakeholders' interest before personal interest

### Case for high ethical standards
To maintain the high ethical standard due to profound effects of the actions can have on:
- **clients** - client's interest: investment professional's responsibility since client has less investment knowledge; governed by strict ethical standards to prevent unfair losses due to negligent or unethical behaviour; investment advice/management are intangible products; therefore trust is important
- **investment profession**  -  integrity of profession: client may lose faith in the whole investment industry
- **society** - wellbeing of society: since financial service industry acts as an intermediary between investors and firms seeking financing for their business activities; "bad advice" risk + investment risks â‡’ â†“ amount investment and â†‘cost of financing; misallocation of capital â‡’ reduces economic growth and well-being

### Challenges to ethical behaviour
There are challenges to ethical behaviour in financial services:
- **Overconfidence** - place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations (internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation)
- **Situational influences** - external factors such as environmental or cultural elements that shape our thinking, decision making and behaviour (e.g. money, prestige, loyalty) - act in own short term self-interest, ignoring the consequences to themselves and to others.
- **Too many and strict rules compliance procedures** - only compliant to the ones listed

## Ethical code and Standards
### Professional code and standards
Being a professional means:
- specialised knowledge
- specialised skills 
to serve clients, not customers, because you're in an ongoing professional relationship with your client and based on trust rather than transactions.

In any given profession, the code of ethics communicates:
- the shared values
- principles
- expected behaviours of its members
some codes of ethics include a set of rules/standards that require some minimal level of ethical behaviour.

The CFA Institute code and standards is principle-based code and standards, based on:
- honesty
- integrity
- transparency
- diligence
- placing client interests first
apply to all candidates and members at all times, regardless of title position, occupation, geographic location or specific situation.

In contrast to rule standards, which are often narrowly defined to apply to specific groups under specific circumstances.

### Ethical vs. legal standards
The code and standards define ethical standards and meant to complement local laws and regulations which define legal standards that too often overlap where the standards govern, actions that are both unethical and illegal. However, not all unethical actions are illegal, and not all illegal actions are unethical.

### Ethical decision-making framework
Making effective ethical decision-making framework should consist of four phases:
- **Identify** - important facts, stakeholders and duties to the stakeholders, applicable ethical and legal requirements
- **Consider** - situational influences/behavioural biases, guidance from trusted sources, consult compliance or legal counsel, guidance from firm's policies/code and standards
- **Decide and act** - arrive at the most ethical decision and act on it
- **Reflect** - assess decision and outcomes, consider whether the decisions had their intended results
