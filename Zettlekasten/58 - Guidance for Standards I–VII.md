- Don't have to memorise the standard number

To navigate topics of ethics:
- Know and understand all the standards
- Read case studies from curriculum text (Application of the Standard from the CFA curriculum)
- Develop intuition for answering questions - practice problems at end of curriculum reading, mock exams provided by CFA institute, end of lesson quizzes

In the event of conflict, Members and Candidates must **comply with the more strict law, rule, or regulation**. Members and Candidates must not knowingly participate or assist in and must **dissociate from any violation** of such laws, rules, or regulations."

**Key messages**:
- know what are the rules that apply and comply with them

Members and Candidates must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, beneâ€€it, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or anotherâ€™s independence and objectivity.

**Key message**:
- client interest must always come first
- can't accept any gift/benefit/compensation as compromise independence and objectivity
- should not give in for the conflict of interest in corporate finance

### I(C) - Misrepresentation
**Definition**: Members and Candidates must not **knowingly** make any **misrepresentations** relating to **investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities**.

- plagiarism without crediting the source
- should not misrepresent your abilities, not citing sources can mislead readers into thinking that the analysis was done by you

### I(D) - Misconduct
**Definition**: Members and Candidates must not engage in any professional conduct involving **dishonesty, fraud, or deceit** or **commit any act that reflects adversely on their
professional reputation, integrity, or competence**.

**Key message**: 
- a certain behaviour may not be illegal but may still violate the standard if it reflects adversely on the profession, integrity or competence of the member
- absence of appropriate conduct can be considered as violation of misconduct

**Definition**: Members and Candidates who possess **material** nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.

**Key message**:
- Any form of insider trading is not allowed
- **material** - disclosure of such information would affect the price of a security of if a reasonable investor would want the information before making an investment decision (e.g. earnings, M&A, new products, adverse auditor opinions, legal disputes, changes in security ratings, reports, stock calls), could be from research houses, not insider information but has the potential to affect market price
- **non-material** - if source of the information is not that reliable, if effect on security price is ambiguous
- **non-public** - information is nonpublic until it has been publicly disseminated or is available to the marketplace in general (e.g. analyst conference call)
- **act** - including personal trade or encouraging clients to trade
- trading in any form of pooled investment, derivatives or alternative investments that have links to the associated security is also a violation
- you violate the standard only if you use the information for purposes other than what it is given to you for
- mosaic theory - analysis based on public and non-material non-public information - acting based on mosaic theory is not a violation of standard
- the public would find the conclusions material does not require that an analyst to make the work public

- Duty of loyalty is owed to the ultimate beneficiaries, investing public as a whole could be your clients
- Index/mutual fund managers - consistent with the stated mandate of the fund, advisor has the duty of determining the suitability for individual clients
- portfolio management - mostly would be in conflict of this standard, as portfolio manager possess more professional knowledge, should follow the investment policy statement, to guide the decision making process and explain investment rationale
- soft commissions (soft dollars) - brokerage fees are paid by the client, should be seeking the best price and best execution for client, is a violation if the soft dollars do not benefit the client, on the other hand, receiving soft dollars is ok if they are used to benefit the client
- proxy voting - vote on behalf of client on shares in the portfolio, vote in an informed and responsible manner in the best interest of your client, due to cost-benefit considerations, it may not be necessary to vote all proxies

- different service levels are ok, as long as they are disclosed and made available to all who wish to pay for it, no client is disadvantaged
- investment recommendation - ensure that the information is disseminated in a manner that all clients have a fair opportunity to act on every recommendation - make sure clients who acted based on earlier recommendation are aware of change
- investment action - treat all clients fairly in light of their investment objectives and circumstances (e.g. over subscribed IPOs should be proportionally allocated to all subscribers)
- ok to round off allocation to meet minimum lot size requirement
- no favourism nor discrimination towards paying client (e.g. immediate family member as paying client, to treat them fairly)
- withholding hot IPOs for own benefit is a violation

**Recommended**:

2. When Members and Candidates are responsible for managing a portfolio to a specific mandate, strategy, or style (e.g. index/mutual fund), they must make only investment - recommendations or take only investment actions that are **consistent with the stated objectives and constraints of the portfolio**.

**Key message**:
- understand the client's **returns objective**, **risk tolerance**, **constraints** (e.g. time horizon, tax exposure, liquidity needs, legal constraints, unique circumstances) "RRTTLLU"
- IPS should be complete and up-to-date before making recommendations
- update at least annually or prior to any material changes to the portfolio
- ask for the changes in number of dependents, tax status, health, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, financial situation, income levels
- **modern portfolio theory** - effective diversification is achieved when the assets within the **portfolio have low correlations of return with each other** 
- unsolicited trade request - from the client's initiative, required to determine the trade's compatibility with the client's IPS and the total portfolio
- for index/mutual fund manager, not the duty of fund managers to ensure suitability of the fund to the public, it's duty of the advisor
