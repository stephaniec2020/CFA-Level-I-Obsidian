## Business structures 
The business structure is tied to the relationship between business, manager, and owner, the debt obligation and liabilities to owner, and the tax treatments.

There are 4 common forms of business structure:
- **Sole proprietorship**
- **General partnership**
- **Limited partnership**
- **Corporation**

### Sole proprietorship
**Sole proprietorship** is when the individual owner have full control over the business, as the owner provides all the capital of the business.

The **sole proprietorship** structure:
- Owner = manager
- Owner is fully liable to the debt of the business (Unlimited liability)
- Tax (Personal income)
- Sole proprietorships tend to be small in scale as they are limited by the owner's individual ability to secure financing

### General partnerships
**General partnerships** is similar to sole proprietorship, however there are more than 1 owner('Partners') and they have full control over the business, as the owner provides all the capital of the business.

The **general partnership** structure:
- Owner = Manager
- **Partnership agreement** - defines roles, responsibility and share of the business for each Partner
- Owner is fully liable to the debt of the business (Unlimited shared liability)
- Tax (Personal income)
- Sole proprietorships tend to be small in scale as they are limited by the owner's individual ability to secure financing

### Limited partnerships
**Limited partnerships** is different from general partnerships, where the owners are need at least one General Partner managing the business

The **limited partnership** structure:
- The General Partner(s) = manager have unlimited liability over the business 
- Limited Partners = Owner have limited liability â‡’ can only lose up to the full amount of investment in the partnership
- Limited Partners are generally not involved with the business, nor they can appoint or remove the General Partners
- **Partnership agreement** will specify on how the profits are divided amongst General Partners and Limited Partners, although Limited Partners might have a bigger proportion, the General Partners may get more given their management responsibilities
- Limited Partners are taxed on their personal income 
e.g. P.E. firms, hedge funds, and law firms are typically structured as limited partnerships

### Corporation (Limited company)
**Limited company** adopts are similar scheme of limited partnerships and evolved, however, it is treated as a **separate legal entity from owners and managers**
- The owners (i.e. shareholders), have limited liability, the maximum amount that they can lose is what they invested in (i.e. share price = $0)
- Managers are not fully liable to the company as shareholders (owners) appoint the board of directors to hire the senior managers to run the company
- The managers are acting of interest to the shareholders
- Capital of the company is from owners' capital (i.e. equity) or lenders (i.e. debt)
- Both equity holders and lenders are considered as investors under the corporation scheme, however, only the shareholders are the owner, and the lenders are investors but not owner.

#### Not-for-profit and for-profit corporation
Corporation can be not-for-profit and for-profit:
- **Not-for-profit** are for social benefits/charity, the corporation can generate profit but the profit must be reinvested in the corporation and the profit cannot be distributed to the owners, they are generally not taxed
- **For-profit** can be a **public** or can be a **private** company
	- **Public company** shares are sold to the public and trade in the exchange, in some cases if the shareholders are accumulated to a certain amount and not listed in an exchange, some can be considered as public
	- Public company may distribute some of the profits, but not obligated to
	- After fulfilling its debt obligations and paying corporate taxes, the profit **may be** distributed as dividends including preferred stock dividends, which maybe taxed as personal income for shareholders
	- **Private company** does not meet the definition of the public company
- **Effective tax rate** = $\mathrm{1-(1-Corporate\,tax\,rate) \times (1-Personal\,tax\,rate)}$
The **effective tax rate** is calculated as the government taxed on the profit twice, once on the corporate earning/profit and the second time is on personal tax 

## For-profit corporations and investor claims 
### Private vs public corporations
#### Private
**Private company** require private placements for accredited investors (institutions or HNW individuals) to buy the shares of the company.
The terms of the placement including the terms of placement and investment risks are written down in the **private placement memo (PPM)**. Shares of the private company can't be sold through exchanges so there is no market price. In order to sell the shares, the accredited investors must find another accredited investor to negotiate a deal for transaction of shares. Even so, the private company has the right to veto this transaction. Therefore, due to the liquidity of the private company shares is considered as a "high-risk, high-return" of investment. The investment horizon is long, mostly have to wait till the company goes public or acquired by another company.

#### Public company
Private company can be a **public company** through listed exchanges. They would have **initial public offering (IPO)** for retail investors to trade their shares on a public exchange. The retail investors would not have to go through the company to buy shares.
The public company **must regularly report their financial results** (comply with the accepted accounting principles) and **material information** (major changes - such as major shareholder changes) to the **security regulators (e.g. SEC)**.
IPO prospectus have a more stringent disclosure requirement than the **private placement memo (PPM)**.

Besides IPO, there are other ways of listing a company as public. The two ways are:
- **Direct listing** - Stock exchange allows directly listing the existing shares, which differs from the IPO, where new shares are distributed for raising capital. There are some advantages such as faster listing and no underwriter.
- **Special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) "blank cheque company"** is a corporate structure set up to acquire a private company in the future. The SPAC have IPO which allow retail investors to buy shares, and which will be contributed to a trust. The trust must acquire a company by a specified date.

There are occasions where a **public company go private**. The model that the investors used is a leveraged buyout (LBO) by outside investors, which they take on debt to buy all the shares in the market, so that it gets delisted from a stock exchange. Also, it can be bought by the management and hence its name management buyout (MBO).

### Lender vs shareholder claims
There are two ways of which a company can raise capital, through:
- debt - backed by the banks, loans, and bonds
- equity - (aka, owner's capital)

The company has to pay regular interest to the lenders (e.g. banks, bondholders) but discretionary to shareholders as dividends.
The company defaults if the debt obligations are not met.
At the time of default, the lenders will have the priority of claim, and the shareholders will have the residual claim.

### Maximum downside and upside of both the lender and shareholder
#### Maximum downside
For a company's asset = debt + owner's equity, at the time of liquidation, if the company's asset is greater than the debt, the debt holders have 100% claim of their investment. The remaining asset then can be claimed by the share holders.

However, at times where the asset is lower than the debt capital, the asset of the company goes 100% to the debt holders. Since the shareholders have limited liability, the maximum downside is the amount that the investor that have invested in that company (i.e. share price $\times$ amount of shares)

#### Maximum upside
For a normal company that is running, the maximum upside of the debt holders is the interest received by the company. The maximum upside of the shareholders is unlimited, as the share price should increase as the company's asset increase.

#### Risk for lenders and shareholders
The risk of lender is the interest that they potentially might receive. Therefore, the shareholders risks is greater than the lender as the , therefore the shareholders would demand a higher rate of return.

### Conflict of interest between lenders and shareholders
The **lenders** focuses on the chance of the company default, as the company generate interest for the lenders to recover. However, **shareholders** focuses on a growth aspect of the company, therefore the shareholders prefers leverage through raising debt and capital, so that the share price would increase. However, the lenders may oppose increase in leverage as it increases the probability of default.

### Company's perspective on equity and debt
From the company's point of view, normally the cost of equity > cost of debt. The company would often look to issue new debt as it is cheaper. However, the financial leverage increases, and the current debt holders would not be favour of this. Debt capital is preferred if the issue is confident of meeting the interest payment with a positive cash flow.

Leverage is lowered if the company chooses to issue new shares, however, it creates dilutions from the existing shareholders.
