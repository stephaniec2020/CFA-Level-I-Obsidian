## Capital structure and company life cycle
**Capital Structure:** the amount of **debt and/or equity** employed by a firm to fund its operations and finance its assets. In order to optimise the structure, a firm will decide if it needs more debt or equity and can issue whichever it requires.

**Capital structure** depends on the equity and debt issuance:
When talking about the debt and equity structure, mostly are talking about the market value (not book value):
e.g. If a company's debt is $2M, and market value of outstanding shares are $3M, the company capital structure will be described as "40% Debt, 60% Equity". The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is 2/3 = 67%.

Capital structure is different according to different company, some might be accounted by the life cycle of the company is in.

There are some **characteristics** that will determine the company's capital structure, such as:
- **Revenue growth**
- **Cash flow**
- **Business risk**
- **Availability of debt**
- **Cost of debt**
- **Assets**

In a **mature** company, the growth in equity through retained earnings and the proportion of debt would decrease over time.  Some companies might repurchase debt using excess cash to reduce the proportion of debt in the capital structure.

## Capital structure - Theories of capital structure (MM propositions)
There are **3 theories** of capital structure:
- MM Proposition (No taxes)
- MM Proposition (With taxes)
- Static trade-off theory

This proposition is proposed by two economist Modigliani and Miller, hence the MM proposition.

## Overview of the theories
On the basis of taxes and cost of financial distress, there are 3 theories of capital structure:
- MM Proposition (No taxes) 1958 - where ❌ taxes, ❌ cost of financial distress - According to Modigliani and Miller's Proposition I, under certain assumptions, including the absence of taxes and bankruptcy costs, the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure.
- MM Proposition (With taxes) 1963 - ✅ taxes, ❌ cost of financial distress
- Static trade-off theory - ✅ taxes, ✅ cost of financial distress - Static trade-off theory is the only one which considers the cost of financial distress, which will increase the cost of debt as leverage increases.

In the unrealistic conditions of no taxes and no cost of financial distress, to understand how the **capital structure** and **taxes** play roles in **cost of capital**, which is a realistic explanation of **firm value**. 

The goal of each firm is to **reduce to cost of capital and increase** the **firm value**.

### MM Proposition I (No taxes)
The first MM proposition is that the **capital structure is irrelevant** **(i.e. value of a leveraged firm should be the same as the value of an unleveraged firm)**. In an ideal world with no taxes, it does not matter whether a firm takes on debt or equity in financing its capital. **Levered firms are a firms with a mixture of debt and equity** as capital structure, whereas **unlevered firms are with 100% equity**.

There are some simplifying assumptions made by MM:
- Perfectly competitive markets (no transaction costs, taxes, bankruptcy costs)
- Investors have homogeneous expectations (same expectations with respect to cash flows generated by the firm)
- Riskless borrowing and lending (borrow or lend at the risk-free rate)
- No agency cost (no conflict of interest between managers and shareholders)
- Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions.

Operating cash flow are available to all providers of capital be it through debt or equity. The shareholders will have the discounted value of the company's earnings. If the firm is levered (i.e. debt+equity capital structure), the earnings are split between the debt holders and equity holder. In the ideal world without taxation, the value of the levered firm should be the same as the value of unlevered firm.

Therefore, the value of a levered firm (i.e. mixed capital structure of debt and equity) compared to unlevered firm is unlevered firm is the same with the assumption of no taxes, which is as follows:
$$\mathrm{V_{L}=V_{U}}$$
where $V_L$: value of levered firm; $V_U$: value of unlevered firm.

#### MM Proposition II (No taxes)
According to MM, the proposition II **in the world of no taxes, increase in cost of equity will totally offset the lower cost of debt when leverage increases**.

The cost of debt has to be lower than the cost of equity. Since debt holders have a priority claim on assets and income and therefore **equity holders must be compensated with a higher rate of return** (i.e. cost of equity ($r_e$) > cost of debt ($r_d$)).

However as companies increase their use of debt, the risk to equity holders increases, which in in turn increases the cost of equity.

At zero debt the company is unlevered, which denoted as $R_0$. The WACC is equal to the cost of equity ($r_d$). As the company increases the level of debt the cost of equity increases (i.e. $r_d$ ↑) and this offsets the cost savings from taking on debt.

According to MM, the WACC should remain constant as leverage increases.
The equation of **WACC** with **value of debt and equity** as follows:
$$\mathrm{WACC=r_e\frac{E}{V}+r_d\frac{D}{V}}$$
where $E$: value of equity; $D$: value of debt; $V$: D+E; $r_e$: rate of return of equity; $r_d$: rate of return of debt.

At **unlevered cost of capital $r_0$**, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{r_0=r_e\frac{E}{V}+r_d\frac{D}{V}}$$
and with rearranging the equation, the **cost of equity** is:
$$\mathrm{r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)}$$
where where $D/E$: debt-to-equity ratio; $r_0$: unlevered cost of capital; $r_e$: rate of return of equity; $r_d$: rate of return of debt.

### MM Proposition I (With taxes)
**In the world with taxes, MM proposed that the value of the firm is maximised at 100% debt** **(i.e. value of a leveraged firm increases as leverage increases due to tax shield)**. 

Interest payment is a pre-tax expenses, which is tax deductible. However, the dividends (i.e. what the shareholders would have) are paid on after-tax basis. Therefore, the company which has a debt capital structure will have a higher operating cash flow compare to a 100% equity capital structure. The difference in value of a levered firm and value of unlevered firm is called **tax shield**. 

The **tax shield's** formula is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Tax\,shield = Marginal\,tax\,rate\,(T)\times Value\,of\,debt\,(d)}$$
Therefore, the value of a levered firm (i.e. mixed capital structure of debt and equity) compared to **unlevered firm** is unlevered firm **(100% equity capital structure) + tax shield**, which is as follows:
$$\mathrm{V_{L}=V_{U}+(T \times d)}$$
$V_{L}$: Value of levered firm; $V_{U}$: Value of unlevered firm; T: Marginal tax rate; d: value of debt; value is maximised when the debt leverage is maximised.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-13 at 23.37.31.png]]

#### MM proposition II (with taxes)
The MM proposition II is **increase in cost of equity is reduced by the tax shield, which will lead to the WACC being minimised at 100% debt**.
When tax rate is considered, equation of **WACC** with **value of debt and equity** as follows:
$$\mathrm{WACC=r_e\frac{E}{V}+r_d\frac{D}{V}(1-T)}$$
where $E$: value of equity; $D$: value of debt; $V$: D+E; $r_e$: rate of return of equity; $r_d$: rate of return of debt.

At **unlevered cost of capital $r_0$**, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{r_0=r_e\frac{E}{V}+r_d\frac{D}{V}(1-T)}$$
and with rearranging the equation, the **cost of equity** is:
$$\mathrm{r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)(1-T)}$$
where where $D/E$: debt-to-equity ratio; $r_0$: unlevered cost of capital; $r_e$: rate of return of equity; $r_d$: rate of return of debt; $T$: Marginal tax rate.

The cost of equity (i.e. $r_e$ ↓) is reduced in the tax world, the tax shield provided by debt causes the WACC to decline as leverage increases. This supports the proposition that when taxes are considered company value is maximised at a 100% debt.


The tax shield provided by debt causes the WACC to decrease as leverage increases. The value of the firm is maximized at the point where the WACC is minimized, which is 100% debt under the MM assumptions.

## Static trade-off theory
### Static trade-off theory
The **static trade-off theory** says there is an **optimal capital structure** and the trade-off is between the **tax shield** and the **cost of financial distress**.

$$\mathrm{V_{L}=V_{U}+(T \times d)-PV(cost\,of\,financial\,distress)}$$

The firm value against the degree of financial leverage when debt is zero (i.e. $V_L$=$V_U$). Value of an unlevered firm ($V_U$) also represents MM proposition with no taxes where the value of a leveraged firm is equal to the value of an unlevered firm.

If we factor in tax shield, the value of the firm should always be increasing (i.e. $\mathrm{V_{L}=V_{U}+(T \times d)}$). This represents MM proposition with taxes where the value of the firm is maximised at 100% debt.

Subtracting the costs of financial distress, which increases as the degree of leverage increases, there is the curve of **static trade-off theory**, where the **optimal capital structure** is this sweet spot that **maximises the firm value** (i.e. $\mathrm{V_{L}=V_{U}+(T \times d)-PV(cost\,of\,financial\,distress)}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 00.08.42.png]]

### Target capital structure
MM proposition with no taxes says that the cost of equity increases with leverage, which totally offsets the lower cost of debt. This causes the WACC to be constant regardless of the degree.

The MM proposition with taxes says the increase in cost of equity is partially reduced by the tax shield, which leads to a downward sloping WACC curve.

In both the MM propositions, the implicit assumption is that the cost of debt is constant regardless of the degree of leverage, which is not true under the static trade-off theory.

Due to financial distress, the cost of debt increases with leverage, the cost of debt should curve upwards. As such, the WACC should look like this where the minimum coincides with the optimal capital structure for the company.

#### Firm's optimal capital structure
Every firm will have a different optimal capital structure that depends on:
- Operating risk
- Sales risk
- Tax situation
- Corporate governance
- Industry influences, and other factors.

A firm's target capital structure is the structure that the managers use over time when making decisions about how to raise additional capital.

For managers trying to **maximize the value of the firm**, the target capital structure should be the **same as the optimal capital structure**, and the firm often makes financing decisions that aim to bring the **actual capital structure** closer to the **target**.

e.g. one reason could be that the management may choose to exploit opportunities in a specific financing source. A temporary rise in the firm's stock price may create a good opportunity to issue additional equity, which would result in a higher percentage of equity than the target.

e.g2. The other reason is simply due to market value fluctuation of the company's stocks and bond prices.

A firm should always finance a project based on the firm's weighted average cost of capital, although when evaluating a project, the firm may apply a risk factor to adjust the risk of the project. A corporate manager generally cannot deem some projects as being financed by debt and some by equity as all projects are effectively financed proportionately based on the firm's capital structure. In practice, a firm's actual capital structure will float around its target. For a firm that does have a target capital structure, the actual structure may vary from the target due to market value fluctuations, or management's desire to exploit an opportunity in a particular financing source.

### Costs of financial distress
The costs of financial distress increase as the degree of leverage increases. Debt is considered an obligation and often carries fixed interest costs. As a firm tries to raise more capital through debt, the probability of not being able to service its debt obligations increases.

**Costs of financial distress** refer:
- explicit costs of company default and bankruptcy
- implicit costs due to the stresses of lower earnings or losses that proceed such events
- companies under stress may lose customers, suppliers, and valuable employees.

The probability of financial distress increases:
- As a firm tries to raise more capital through debt, the probability of not being able to service its debt obligations increases.
- Debt investors will demand higher returns to compensate for the higher risk leading to the upward sloping cost of debt curve.
- Low quality of a firm's management
- Bad company's corporate governance structure.

## Factors affecting capital structure decisions
There are several factors when deciding on capital structure:
- **Maintain debt ratings**
- **Business characteristics**
- **External factors**
- **Agency costs**
- **Costs of asymmetric information**

### Maintain debt ratings
Credit rating agencies assess the credit quality of **both the issuer** and the **individual debt issues** and **assign ratings to them based on their risk of default**.

Managers are particularly mindful of the **company's debt rating** because the company's **cost of capital (WACC)** is closely tied to its debt rating. Historically, the difference in yield between a triple AAA bond and a BBB- rated bond has averaged a 100 basis points (100bp).

If a bond rating drops from investment grade to speculative grade, the cost of capital increases considerably.

Credit ratings can be factored into management's capital structure policy if a firm has a minimum rating objective, and this is likely to be adversely affected by issuing additional debt.

#### Summary slide of credit ratings of bonds

Managers are very concerned with accounting ratios:
- **Coverage ratios** - EBIT/Interest expense
- **Leverage ratios** - debt-to-equity
- **Current ratios, quick ratio, cash ratio** - Liquid assets like cash and receivables are looked upon favourably.

### Business characteristics
The **business model characteristics** play an important role in capital structure designs. 

In general, the more stable and predictable a company's revenues and cash flows are, the more debt it can support (i.e. stable and predicable cash flow = sustain more debt).

Stable and predictable cash flow companies are:
- **In non-cyclical industries**
- **Subscription-based revenue models**
- **Low proportion of fixed costs**
- **"Asset-light"** - lease fixed assets instead of owning them, outsourcing certain work functions to reduce labour cost, lower operating leverage
- **Types of asset owned are** - tangible assets, liquid assets, fungible assets so there is a wider pool of potential buyers (i.e. assets that are likely to have a high recovery value in the event of a liquidation are preferred by creditors)

#### Debt capacity
A company's **debt capacity** is the **total amount of debt the company can take on and repay without causing insolvency**.

There are several measures that analysts use to estimate a company's ability to support more debt:
- **Current ratio** - current asset/current liabilities - ability to meet **short-term** debt obligation
- **Profitability ratio** - EBIT or EBITDA/revenue - **earnings available** to service debt
- **Leverage ratio** - Total debt/EBITDA - number of years to pay off all debt (lower than 3 is consider good)
- **Interest coverage ratio** - number of times company can cover its interest expense with 1 year earning (measure of financial cushion in meeting debt obligation)

The firm's marginal income tax rate is also an important factor as interest expense is a tax deductible expense in many jurisdictions. The higher the firm's marginal tax rate, the greater the benefit of using debt over equity.

### External factors
Market conditions can also influence a firms' financing decisions.

For equity, if the management perceive the market price of their stock to be temporarily high, they may choose to **issue stocks to take advantage of the market bullishness**. Conversely, if managers feel their stock is undervalued, **they may repurchase their stock** from the open market.

Debt-wise, when market interest rates fall, or are thought to be temporarily low, the management may prefer to issue debt to take advantage of the lower interest cost.

In some industries, there can be regulatory constraints with regard to capital structure. 
e.g. financial institutes and public utility companies are required to meet **capital adequacy standards**

Company management may take reference from its peers when making capital-structured decisions, perhaps not to stand out and invite criticism from analysts.

### Agency costs
**Agency costs** refer to the **cost associated with the conflict of interest** between a firm's management and shareholders.

Risks are borne by the company's shareholders, while the management's compensation is often tied to company performance, which may lead to excessive risk taking by the managers. The **net agency cost of equity** is where the company shareholders taking steps to minimise excessive risk, and there are 3 components:
- **Monitoring costs** - costs associated with supervising the management (e.g. expenses associated with making annual reports to shareholders, and paying the board of directors)
- **Bonding costs** - assumed by the management to assure shareholders that they're working in the shareholders' best interest (e.g. bonding costs include the premiums for insurance to guarantee performance and implicit costs associated with non-compete employment contracts signed by the management)
- **Residual losses** - may occur even with adequate monitoring and bonding provisions.

According to Agency Theory, the issuance of debt rather than equity, forces managers to be disciplined with regard to how they spend cash because the company has less free cash flow after meeting its interest obligations. As such, the theory states that with higher financial leverage, the agency costs of equity are reduced.

### Costs of asymmetric information
**Costs of asymmetric information** refer to **cost resulting from the fact that managers typically have more information about a company's prospects and future performance than shareholders or creditors**.

Firms with complex products or little transparency in financial statements tend to have higher costs of asymmetric information, which results in higher required returns on debt and equity capital.

Shareholders and creditors are aware that the management know more than they do, these investors will try to infer **signals** from the management's actions. 

**Debt financing (i.e. debt issuance)** is making a **commitment to make fixed interest payments and is usually a sign of manager confidence in having future cash flows** that are able to meet these obligations.

**Equity issuance** is typically viewed as a **negative signal that managers** **believe the firms' stock is overvalued**. The signalling model suggests that there may be a hierarchy to the selection of methods for financing new investments.

#### Pecking Order Theory
The **pecking order theory** suggests that managers **choose methods of financing according to a hierarchy that gives first preference to methods with the least potential information content** and lowest preference to the form with the greatest potential information content.

The order is usually internally generated equity which is retained earnings followed by debt, and public equity offering is the least preferred. 

According to this theory, managers **raising additional capital through public equity issuance can sometimes be seen as a sign of desperation**, which may be an indication that the management has run out of financing options. This is a negative signal regarding the company's future prospects.

## Stakeholder increase in capital structure decisions
There are various stakeholders which can be broadly divided into two types:
- **Risk-preferred (higher debt)** - profit more when company outperforms
	- Common stockholders
	- Controlling shareholders
	- Private equity owners
	- Managers/directors
- **Stability-preferred (lower debt)** - may not profit much when company outperforms.
	- Preferred stockholders
	- Public debt holders
	- Bank/private lenders
	- Employees
	- Suppliers/customers
	- Government

### Public debtholders
**Public debt holders** or bond holders:
- are often paid fixed interest with a return of capital at maturity.
- return's upside is limited with respect to company performance.
- priority of claims when it comes to liquidation, they could still potentially lose up to 100% of their capital if the company is totally unable to repay the debt.

Between debt holders (**long-term vs short-term vs senior debtholders**):
- less concerned with longer-term risks.
- owners of senior debt that is backed by valuable liquid assets, can be less concerned with the company taking on more risks.

### Common stockholder 
**Common equity holders**
- likely to lose 100% of their investment in the event of liquidation
- unlimited upside
- may prefer greater debt financing, as that allows the company to grow faster.

This asymmetry of outcomes creates a conflict of interest, where debt holders prefer that the company issues less debt to limit risk, so as to decrease the probability of default.

### Preferred stockholders
**Preferred stockholders**' stance on capital structure:
- should pretty much align with public debt holders since they similarly do not share any upside as they are paid a fixed dividend,
- could potentially lose 100% in the worst case.
- the priority for payments of preferred stock dividends is after debt holders 
- Preferred stock also has no maturity date so it can be considered very long-term.

### Controlling shareholders and private equity owners
**Private equity and controlling shareholders** are grouped together:
- they tend to have considerable influence in company operations
-  interest may sometimes differ from the minority shareholders so there is potential for some conflict of interests
- controlling shareholder may oppose share issuance that would dilute their holdings or lead to a loss of control.

### Senior managers/ directors
**Senior managers or directors**:
-  may have significant ownership of a firm's common stock.
- Senior managers in particular may be compensated with stock options that affect their incentives.
- Owning stock options magnifies the benefits of increases in share values and can therefore increase management's appetite for risk.
- Sometimes, managers may prefer to issue debt to raise money to repurchase stock, which has the effect of increasing share prices. This effectively increases the proportion of debt in the capital structure and the financial risk of the company.
- A counter argument is that some senior managers and board members are often very highly paid for the work involved. They may prefer that the company take on less risk as they focus primarily on the company's survival and their continued employment.

### Banks/private lenders
**Banks and private lenders** are grouped together:
- unlike bond holders, banks and private lenders often have access to non-public information about a firm's operations.
- These lenders can more easily restructure debt or adjust terms if problems arise and they often work with management to ensure that their interests are considered in company decisions regarding investments and the issuance of additional debt.

### Employees
**Employees** are a group:
- that are often the most neglected when it comes to capital structure decisions.
- Although some employees own the company's common stock in retirement accounts or employee stock ownership plans, the value of these often pale in comparison to the value of their employment.
-  they have far more to lose if they lose their jobs than what they gain if the company outperforms.

### Customers and suppliers
Their **customers and suppliers**:
- they can be significantly impacted if the company goes under
- customers would be concerned with the survival of the company so their supplies do not get disrupted
- Suppliers typically are short term creditors of a firm and have an interest in the firm's continuing ability to meet its obligations.
- Some suppliers have invested time and capital in developing customized products for the firm and will lose significant revenue if that firm fails.

### Government/regulators
**Government and regulators**:
- can set limits on the proportion of debt for certain companies to ensure the protection of consumers, industry, and the economy.
- In particular, financial institutions are required to maintain minimum proportions of equity financing, effectively restricting their ability to issue debt or pay cash dividends.
- Regulated utilities may be limited in the prices they can charge, with allowable prices set in reference to their cost of capital.
	- advantage to utilities in using debt financing because the cost of debt capital is easier to estimate, while the cost of equity is volatile and harder to estimate.
- Some companies deemed too big or too essential to fail. In these cases, governments often require the companies to forego dividend payments and share repurchases and maintain minimum proportions of equity in their capital structures.
