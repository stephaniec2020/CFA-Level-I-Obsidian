## Bonds
**Bond** is a contract hold between a **lender (bondholder)** and **borrower (bond issuer)**. 

There are 4 important factors (and more in later lessons) on the **bond contract**:
- **Maturity date** - end of the bond's term, borrower (bond issuer) is obligated to repay the full face value of the bond to the lender (bondholder)
- **Face/par value** - predetermined amount that the bond issuer promises to repay to the bondholder at maturity
- **Coupon rate** - fixed interest rate specified in the bond contract. It determines the periodic interest payments that the bond issuer makes to the bondholder which remains constant throughout the life of the bond.
- **Payout frequency** - how often the bond issuer makes coupon payments to the bondholder

The bonds can be issued at:
- **par** - coupon rate = market interest rate
- **discount** - coupon rate < market interest rate at issuance
- **premium** - coupon rate > market interest rate at issuance

Coupon > Yield = Premium
Coupon = Yield = Par
Coupon < Yield = Discount

Regarding the usage of rate and yield, they can be used interchangeably in some contexts, but they can also have specific meanings depending on the context. Generally, the rate refers to the stated interest rate on the bond, such as the coupon rate. The yield, on the other hand, represents the return or earnings generated by the bond and is often expressed as a percentage. Yield can be calculated using different methodologies, such as current yield, yield to maturity, or yield to call, depending on the specific characteristics of the bond and the investor's perspective.

### Bonds at par
**At issuance**, when the bond is **issued at par**, the lender (bondholder) will pay the issue price at par. **During the term of the bond**, the borrower has to pay the lender coupon payment (face value x coupon rate) and the promised frequency. **At maturity**, the lender has to repay the bondholder the principal.

**Effective rate** is the **interest rate equates the present value of the future cash flows with the issue price (use the PV function to calculate the interest rate)**, **do not confuse this with the coupon rate**. The only time that the effective interest rate coincides with the coupon rate is when the bond is issued at par.

>Debbie is choosing between purchasing 2 bonds offered by the same company.
>
>Bond A is a 5-yr, $10,000 par, 4% coupon paid annually. Â It is offered at par.
>Bond B is a 5-yr, $10,000 par, zero coupon bond. Â It is offered at a discounted price of $8,200.
>
>If coupons does not matter to Debbie, and she just wants the highest IRR for the 5 year term, which bond will she most likely pick?
>
>Bond A is offered at par. Its effective rate is therefore 4%.
>For Bond B, (N=5, PV=-8200, PMT=0, FV=10000) -> effective rate = 4.05%

#### Financial statements and bonds at par
**At issuance**
In the balance sheet, there is an increase of cash in asset and equally, the bond liability of bond amount in the liability section. The bond liability is not going to be changed as the bond was issued at par.
On the cash flow statement, there is an increase in **CFF** of the equivalent amount of the bond.

**During term**
In the income statement, the **interest expense** for the period is going to be the coupon payment (i.e. effective interest rate = coupon rate only bond issued at par).
Under **US GAAP**, it is reported as **CFO**. 
Under **IFRS**, it can be reported as **CFO** or **CFF**.

**At maturity**
The balance sheet would not have the asset and liability of the bond anymore. 
In the cash flow statement, there will be a negative outflow of **CFF** of the equivalent amount of bond amount. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.32.20.png]]

### Bonds at discount
**At issuance**
When the bond is **issued at discount**, the **lender (bondholder) will pay the issue price at a discount (i.e. price lower than the face value)**. However, the borrower will have to return the face value of the bond at the maturity date.
The borrower would only receive the amount of the proceeds raised (i.e. issue price, which is discount of the face value).

**During the term of the bond**
The borrower has to pay the lender coupon payment (face value x coupon rate) and the promised frequency. 

**At maturity**
The lender has to repay the bondholder the principal (i.e. face value of the bond). 

**Effective rate** of the bond issued at discount would be higher than the coupon rate, as it is the interest rate that equates the present value of the future cash flow.

#### Financial statements and bonds at discount
**At issuance**
In the balance sheet, there is an increase of cash in asset and equally at the discount rate, the bond liability of bond amount in the liability section. 
On the cash flow statement, there is an increase in **CFF** of the equivalent amount of the bond.

**During term**
In the **income statement**, the **interest expense (effective interest method)** for the period is going to be as follows:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,expense=Book\,value \times Effective\,interest\,rate}$$where the effective interest rate is calculated through the calculator by inputting (N, PV, PMT, FV â‡’ I/Y: effective interest rate)
The **interest expense (effective interest method)** will change according to the year, since the book value will be increasing every year till the face value of the bond.

**Note**, the amount of the cash flow recorded in **cash flow statement** is the **coupon payment**, and not the interest expense!

Under **US GAAP**, it is reported as **CFO**.
Under **IFRS**, it can be reported as **CFO** or **CFF**. 

**At maturity**
The balance sheet would not have the asset and liability of the bond anymore. 
In the cash flow statement, there will be a negative outflow of CFF of the equivalent amount of bond amount.

### Bonds at premium
**At issuance**, when the bond is **issued at premium**, the lender (bondholder) will pay the issue price at a premium. **During the term of the bond**, the borrower has to pay the lender coupon payment (face value x coupon rate) and the promised frequency. **At maturity**, the lender has to repay the bondholder the principal.

**Effective rate** of the bond issued at discount would be lower than the coupon rate, as it is the interest rate that equates the present value of the future cash flow.

#### Financial statements and bonds at premium
**At issuance**
In the balance sheet, there is an increase of cash in asset and equally at the discount rate, the bond liability of bond amount in the liability section. 
On the cash flow statement, there is an increase in CFF of the equivalent amount of the bond.

**During term**
In the **income statement**, the **interest expense (effective interest method)** for the period is going to be as follows:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,expense=Book\,value \times Effective\,interest\,rate}$$where the effective interest rate is calculated through the calculator by inputting (N, PV, PMT, FV â‡’ I/Y: effective interest rate)
The **interest expense (effective interest method)** will change according to the year, since the book value will be increasing every year till the face value of the bond.

**Note**, the amount of the cash flow recorded in **cash flow statement** is the **coupon payment**, and not the interest expense!

Under **US GAAP**, it is reported as **CFO**.
Under **IFRS**, it can be reported as **CFO** or **CFF**. 

**At maturity**
The balance sheet would not have the asset and liability of the bond anymore. 
In the cash flow statement, there will be a negative outflow of **CFF** of the equivalent amount of bond amount. 

>Which of the following statements for a bond issued with a coupon rate above the market rate of interest isÂ _accurate_?
>- The associated interest expense will be lower than that implied by the coupon rate.
>- The bond will be shown on the balance sheet at the premium value.
>The value of the bond's premium will be amortised toward zero over the life of the bond, not the value of the bond.

>A bond is issued with the following data:
>-   $10 million face value
>-   9% coupon rate.
>-   8% market rate.
>-   3-year bond with semiannual payments.
>
>Assuming market rates do not change, what will the bond's market value be one year from now and what is the total interest expense over the life of the bond?
>
>Value in 1-Year: 10,181,495
>Total Interest Expense: 2,437,893
>
>To determine the bond's market value one year from now: FV = 10,000,000; N = 4; I = 4; PMT = 450,000; CPT â†’ PV = $10,181,495.
>
>To determine the total interest expense:
>1.  FV = 10,000,000; N = 6; I = 4; PMT = 450,000; CPT â†’ PV = $10,262,107. This is the price the purchaser of the bond will pay to the issuer of the bond. From the issuer's point of view this is the amount the issuer will receive from the bondholder.
>2. **Total interest expense over the life of the bond is equal to the difference between the amount paid by the issuer and the amount received from the bondholder.** 
>   [(6)(450,000) + 10,000,000] â€“ 10,262,107 = 2,437,893


>Question: A company issues $10,000,000 face value of 5% annual coupon, 3-year bonds on January 1, 20X1, raising $8,000,000 in cash proceeds. Using the effective interest method, and ignoring issuance costs, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 20X2 isÂ _closest_Â to: $1,163,000.
> 
> Cash interest paid each year is 5% Ã— $10,000,000 = $500,000. To calculate the effective interest rate: N = 3; PV = 8,000,000; FV = â€“10,000,000; PMT = â€“500,000; CPT I/Y = 13.55%
> 
> The initial bond liability equals the proceeds raised of $8,000,000. Interest expense for 20X1 = 13.55% Ã— $8,000,000 = $1,084,000. The bond liability amortizes (toward face value at maturity) by the difference between interest expense and cash interest paid: $1,084,000 â€“ $500,000 = $584,000.
> 
> The bond liability at the beginning of 20X2 = $8,000,000 + $584,000 = $8,584,000. Interest expense for 20X2 = 13.55% Ã— $8,584,000 = $1,163,132.

> Question: On December 31, 2004, Newberg, Inc. issued 5,000 $1,000 face value 7% bonds to yield 6%. The bonds pay interest semi-annually and are due December 31, 2011. On its December 31, 2005, income statement, Newburg should report interest expense of: $316,448.
> 
> Newberg, upon issuance of the bonds, recorded bonds payable of N = 2 Ã— 7 = 14, PMT = $175,000, I/Y = 6/2 = 3, FV = $5,000,000, CPT PV = $5,282,402. 
> Interest expense June 30, 2005, was $5,282,402 Ã— (0.06 / 2) = $158,472. 
> The coupon payment was $175,000, reducing bonds payable to $5,282,402 â€“ ($175,000 - $158,472) = $5,265,874. 
> Interest expense December 31, 2005, was $5,265,874 Ã— (0.06 / 2) = $157,976. 
> Total interest expense in 2005 was $158,472 + $157,976 = $316,448.

## Discount or premium amortisation
**Discount or premium amortisation** refers to the process of allocating or spreading the amortisable amount of a bond or other debt instrument over the term of the bond or debt's life, which is recorded in the **balance sheet (bond liability)** and **income statement (interest expense)**.

Methods of discount/premium amortisation:
- **Effective interest amortisation method** - required under **IFRS**, preferred under **US GAAP**
- **Straight line amortisation method** - prohibited under IFRS, permitted under **US GAAP**

### Effective interest amortisation method
The **effective interest amortisation method** is based on the concept that interest expense should be recognized in each period in a way that reflects the effective interest rate of the bond. Under this method, the interest expense is calculated by applying a constant interest rate to the carrying value of the bond.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the effective interest amortisation method:
1. **Calculate the effective interest rate:** This is typically the market rate at the time of issuance (I/Y: effective interest rate).
2. **Determine the bond's carrying value (book value)**: It starts with the initial issuance price and adjusts for any amortisation or accretion of premium or discount.
3. **Calculate the interest expense**: Multiply the carrying value by the effective interest rate to determine the interest expense for each period. (i.e. $\mathrm{Book\,value \times EIR}$)
4. **Calculate discount amortisation**: Subtract the coupon payment from the interest expense to find the discount amortisation (i.e. $\mathrm{Interest\,expense - Coupon\,payment}$)
5. **Adjust the carrying value (book value)**: Subtract the interest expense from the carrying value to arrive at the new carrying value for the next period. (i.e. $\mathrm{Book\,value+Discount\,amortisation}$)

Using this method, the interest expense recognized in each period varies, reflecting the changing carrying value of the bond and the effective interest rate.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.46.56.png]]

> A year ago, a firm issued a 6-yr bond with $1 million face value, with a 5% coupon paid annually. Â The effective rate at issuance was 4%. What is the most likely current book value of the bond liability? (Use the effective interest method)

> Beginning BV =$1.052 million (from Qn 1) 
> Interest expense = $1.052 x 4% = $42,097
> Amortised discount for yr 1 = $42,097 â€“ $50,000 = $7,903
> Ending BV = $1.052 â€“ $0.008 = $1.044 million

### Straight line amortisation method
The **straight-line amortisation method** is a simpler approach that evenly allocates the bond's discount or premium over its life. Under this method, the **same amount of amortisation is recognized in each period**, resulting in a **constant interest expense** throughout the bond's term.

Here's how the **straight-line amortisation method** works:
1. **Determine the bond's discount or premium**: It is the difference between the initial issuance price and the bond's face value. (i.e. $\mathrm{Issuance\,price-Face\,value}$)
2. **Calculate the amortisation amount**: Divide the discount or premium by the total number of periods (usually years) until maturity. (i.e. $\mathrm{\frac{Discount\,or\,premium}{Number\,of\,periods}}$)
3. **Recognise the interest expense**: Add the amortisation amount to the bond's stated interest payment (coupon payment) to determine the interest expense for each period. (i.e. $\mathrm{Coupon\,payment+Amortised\,amount}$)
4. **Adjust the carrying value (if necessary)**: If the bond has a discount, increase the carrying value by the amortization amount. If it has a premium, decrease the carrying value by the amortization amount. (i.e. $\mathrm{Book\,value+Discount\,or\,Premium}$)

By employing the straight-line amortisation method, the **interest expense recognized remains constant over the bond's life**, while the **bond's carrying value (i.e. book value) gradually approaches its face value**.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.48.13.png]]

## Zero coupon bonds
**Zero coupon bonds** are debt instruments that **do not pay periodic interest (coupon)** payments to bondholders. Instead, they are issued at a discount to their face value and mature at their face value, with the difference between the purchase price and the face value representing the interest earned on the bond.

The difference between the discounted price and the face value is considered as interest income that accrues over the life of the bond, which has to be **written down as interest expense on income statement**. The **discount amortisation** is the **full amount of interest expense** for every period.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.50.57.png]]

## Issuance costs
**Issuance costs** are the costs incurred with issuing the bonds. 

**Issuance cost** includes:
- the legal and accounting fees
- printing costs
- sales commissions
- other fees.

#### US GAAP and issuance costs
**Under US GAAP**, the issuance costs:
- it was mandatory under US GAAP before 2016 and it is placed as the **balance sheet** as **asset** under **issuance costs and deferred charge**. The **liability** **remains the same** as the bond issued.
- In the **income statement,** the **deferred charge is allocated as an expense over term of the bond as interest expense (as straight line method)**. 
- In the **cash flow statement**, the **CFF is net of the issuance proceeds** 
  (i.e. $\mathrm{Cash\,received - Issuance\,cost}$).

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.58.12.png]]

#### IFRS and issuance costs
**Under US GAAP**, the issuance costs:
- The **asset** and **liability** would be the **net after deducting the issuance costs**.
- There would be an increase in **effective interest rate (through I/Y)**. Therefore, the interest expense will be multiply the carrying value (book value) by the effective interest rate  (i.e. $\mathrm{Book\,value \times EIR}$)
- In the **cash flow statement**, the **CFF is net of the issuance proceeds** 
  (i.e. $\mathrm{Cash\,received - Issuance\,cost}$) - same as **US GAAP**.
- it is allowed under US GAAP after 2016. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 13.11.52.png]]
**Effective interest rate under IFRS**
**Under IFRS**, the initial bond liability on the balance sheet is reduced by the amount of issuance costs. So in this case, the firm will increase assets and liabilities by $95,099 instead of $96,099 .
This has the effect of increasing the bonds effect of interest rate. Punch these figures into your time value of money calculator and you should get an effective interest rate of 7.9%.

**Income expense of Income statement under IFRS**
Now with this increased effective rate, calculate the first year interest expense under IFRS.
Taking the beginning bond liability multiplied by the effective rate of 7.9%, we get an interest expense of $7,513. Notice that this is higher than the $7,207 interest expense if we did not consider the issuance cost. **In effect, issuance costs are treated as unamortised discount under IFRS.**

Like under US GAAP, bond issuance costs are usually netted against the bond proceeds and reported on the cash flow statement as a financing cash flow. So in this case, $95,099 will be reported on the cash flow statement as an inflow from financing activities.

## Fair value option
#### Market yield vs effective rate at issuance
The **book value** of the bond liability is **based on effective rate at issuance**. The **market yield** of the bond, however, **does not stay constant**. 

The **market yield** fluctuates according to:
- market price of the bond, which is influenced by the prevailing interest rate
- company risk factors

So we may have a situation, for example, where the market price of the bond differs significantly from the book value of the bond liability. Now that in itself may not be that big of an issue.

The bond issuer, after all, is still **obligated to make the same amount of coupon payments and return the same par value at maturity**. In some cases, however, it may be more accurate to **value the bond at fair value** instead.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 21.20.08.png]]

For example, as in this case, the firm issued the bond when the **market yield** was lower (i.e. higher price means lower yield). Later, when the **market yield increases, the market price drops correspondingly**. It may be advantageous for the bond issuer to **repurchase** the bond at its now lower market value.

**Repurchase bonds** **removes the bond liability** on the **balance sheet**, thereby:
- the debt level of the firm â†“ 
- debt-to-assets ratio â†“ 
- debt-to-equity ratio â†“ 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 21.20.23.png]]

Both IFRS and US GAAP give firms the irrevocable option to report debt at fair value. Under this option, gains and losses that result from changes in bonds market price are reported in the **income statement**. For analysis, the **market value of a firm's debt may be more appropriate than its book value**.

## Derecognition of bonds
**Derecognition** is when a bond retires.

At different time of derecognition, the value may differ:
- **Maturity**
- **Prior to maturity**

**Maturity**
- When a bond is derecognized at maturity, its **book value and face value are the same**.
- The **firm returns book value of cash to redeem full face value of liability**.
- **no gain/loss recognized in the income statement**. 

**Prior to maturity**
- A firm can choose to redeem the bond before maturity. 
- can be due to a rise in interest rates making it cheaper to redeem the outstanding bonds
- can be due to the firm has generated surplus cash for which the best capital decision is to use it to redeem outstanding bonds. 
- when bonds are redeemed before maturity it's likely that they'll be redeemed at close to market price, which may differ from the book value; **Income statement** marked the difference between book value and market price to redeem the liability **under continuing operations**.
- **Cash paid to redeem a bond is classified as a CFF**. 

However, as redeeming debt is not part of a firm's day-to-day operations, some analysts may choose to eliminate such gains/losses from the operating profit for analysis purposes.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 21.27.00.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 01.50.18.png]]

>To take advantage of the prevailing low interest rates, Tutlis Corp decided to redeem some of its outstanding bonds. Â Tutlis paid $9.3 million to redeem the bonds. Â The book value of the bonds redeemed was $8.2 million. What should be the accounting treatment of this transaction?
>
>Book a loss of $1.1 million on the income statement.

#### US GAAP and derecognition of bonds before maturity
Recall that under **US GAAP** issuance costs are capitalised as a deferred charge to be amortised over the term of the bond. If there are any remaining unamortised issuance costs they must be written off and included in the gain or loss calculation. This has the effect of decreasing the gain or deepening the loss. 

#### IFRS and derecognition of bonds before maturity
**No write-off is necessary under IFRS** because the issuance costs are already accounted for in the book value of the bond liability.

## Debt Covenants
**Debt covenants** are **restrictions imposed by the lender** on the borrower to protect the lender's position. Debt covenants can **reduce default risk** and thus **reduce borrowing costs**. The restrictions can be in the form of **affirmative covenants** or **negative covenants**. **Covenants** are usually discussed in **footnotes**.

**Affirmative covenants:**
- Make timely payments of principal and interest
- Maintain **certain ratios**, such as the current, debt-to-equity, and interest coverage ratio
- Maintain collateral, if any in working order.

**Negative covenants:**
- Increasing dividends and repurchasing shares
- Issuing more debt
- Engaging in M&A
- Any other factor that would affect the ability for the borrower to repay its debt

If the borrower **violates any of the covenants, technical default** is said to have occurred.
The **bond holder can demand immediate repayment of principle**. 

While covenants only apply to a firm's debt instruments, an analyst needs to study them when valuing the firm's equity as well. Restrictions that are placed on the firm can hamper the firm's growth prospects.

## Presentation and disclosures
Firms will often report all of their outstanding long-term debt on a single line on the balance sheet. The portion that is **due within the next year** is reported as a **current liability** and the rest is reported as a **non-current liability**.

**Details of long-term debt are often disclosed in the footnotes**. Analysts may find the details are useful in determining the timing and amounts of future cash outflows.

### Footnotes of long-term liabilities
**Footnotes** are additional pieces of information or explanations that are included at the bottom of typically a financial statement, which includes information such as:
- The nature of the liabilities
- Maturity dates
- Stated and effective interest rate
- Call provisions and conversion privileges
- Restrictions imposed by creditors
- Assets pledged as security
- Amount of debt maturing of the next five years

### Management, discussion & analysis (MD&A)
In the **MD&A**, there could be quantitative and qualitative analysis, such as:
- Discussions on obligations that are due to mature in the future
- Trends in the firm's capital structure
- Material changes in the mix and cost of debt

## Lease
**Lease** is a contractual arrangement whereby the **lessor allows a lessee to use the asset** for a **specified period of time** in return for **periodic payments**. 

### Motivation of lease
There are several motivation for the lessee to borrow an asset instead of owning it.

For the **lessee**:
- Less costly financing, as usually does not require down payment (reserve more cash)
- Reduced risk of obsolescence - the asset will be returned back to the lessor
- Less restrictive provisions in financing - as it can be agreed on a financing agreement that best suit both the needs of lessor and lessee

There are 2 types of leases:
- **Finance lease** (also known as capital lease) - purchased financed with debt
- **Operating lease** - act similarly to "rental agreement"

### Finance lease
**Finance lease** is:
- purchase of an asset financed with debt
- the lessor sells an asset at fair market value to lessee, and the lessee takes a loan of the purchase price from the lessor
- involves in **transfer of the asset** to the **lesses's balance sheet**.

For the lessor, it can be treated as **sales-type** or **direct financing** under **US GAAP**. At inception, the lessor signs a contract with the lessee to lay out the terms of payments that the lessee has to pay over the contractural period. There are two periods of time which the financial statements for lease: **at inception**, and **over term of lease**. 

#### At inception (Finance lease)
##### Lessor and sales-type finance lease
At inception, the **PV of the lease receipts** are being written as sales in the **income statement**. The **lease asset** is removed in the **balance sheet** and put as **COGS** in the **income statement**. The gross profit is then:
$$\mathrm{Gross\,profit = PV\,of\,lease\,receipts-COGS}$$
On the balance sheet, it is recognised as lease receivable under account receivable, which is the PV of lease receipts.

##### Lessor and direct financing finance lease
Different from sales-type finance lease, there will not be a gross profit recognised by the lessor at inception. On the balance sheet, it is recognised as lease receivable under account receivable, which is the PV of lease receipts.

##### Lessee and sales-type finance lease
- **balance sheet**: it is written as the **"Right of Use" asset**, which is the **PV of lease payments**, and **at the same time lease liability of the same amount (i.e. PV of lease)**. 

**Here is the summarised figure for finance lease at inception:**
![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 22.18.39.png]]

#### Over the term of lease (Finance lease)
##### Lessee and lease
Over the term of the lease, the **"right-of-use" asset** is **depreciated**. 

**Balance sheet**:
- depreciate by the amount of **depreciation expense** in **asset**
- depreciate by the **interest expense** in lease **liability**

**In the income statement**:
- **Depreciation expense** as well as **interest expense** is reported in the lessee income statement.
- The **interest expense** is equal to the **lease liability at the beginning of the period, multiplied by the interest rate implicit** in the lease.
$$\mathrm{Interest\,expense = Lease\,liability\,BOP \times Implicit\,interest\,rate}$$
BOP: beginning of period.

**In the cash flow statement**:
- The **interest expense** is reported as an outflow from **CFO**
- the **principal repayment** is recorded as a **CFF**. 
- **Lease payment** is the sum of **interest expense** and **principal repayment**.
In some cases, **IFRS** allows **interest expense** to be classified under **CFF**.

>An airline that reports under IFRS leased an airplane for 10 years. The annual payments of $15 million is to be made each year on the first day of the lease. 
>The implicit lease interest rate is 7%. The amount of interest expense recognised by the airline in the first year is closest to: $6.8M
>
>Beginning lease liability (N=10, I/Y=7, PMT=15M, FV=0) **BGN mode**. Â => Â PV=$112.7M
>After first lease payment, lease liability = $112.7M â€“ $15M = $97.7M
>1st year interest expense = $97.7M x 7% = $6.8M

##### Lessor and lease
As the lease payments are received by the lessor,

**Balance sheet**:
- deduct the **lease receivable (account receivable)** by the **principal reduction**
- increase in the **interest income** 

**Income statement**:
- the **interest income** received is reported in the lessor's income statement

**Cash flow statement**:
- the **interest income** is reported as an **CFO**, in some instances, **IFRS** allows classification of **interest income** as **CFI**
- the **principle reduction** is reported as an **CFI**.

## Operating lease
#### At inception (Operating lease)
**Lessor**:
- have the asset reported at **carrying value** in **balance sheet**

**Lessee**:
- report the **"right-of-use" asset** **on the balance sheet** and equally the **lease liability** of the same amount.

#### Over the term of the lease (Operating lease)
**Lessee and over the term of operating lease**
- **Balance sheet**: **the "right-of-use" asset is depreciated** and the **lease liability** is reduced as payments are made.
- **Income statement**: The **lease expense** has a **straight-line** allocation over the cost of the lease over its term.
- **Cash flow statement**: the **lease payment** is written down under the **CFO**.

**Lessor and over the term of operating lease**
- **Balance sheet**: the **asset carrying value** is **depreciated as depreciation expense**
- **Income statement**: **lease income** received from lessee, **depreciation expense**
- **Cash flow statement**: **lease income** is under the **CFO**

#### Exceptions of operating lease
Some exceptions of operating lease:
- short-term lease (<1year), and 
- in the **IFRS only**, the asset is of **low-value**. 

**Balance sheet**: The asset and liability is not being written down
**Income statement**: rent expense
**Cash flow statement**: rent expense

### Criteria for choosing lease type
The **criteria** for choosing the method of lease recognition is through understanding whether the benefits and risks of owning the leased asset is transferred to the lessee.

There are different types of lease type: 

#### Criteria for choosing lease type (US GAAP)
**Under US GAAP**, if it fulfils the criteria, it should be a finance lease. In particular, a sales type lease for the lessor. Otherwise, it would be an operating lease for both lessor and lessee.

However, under US GAAP lessors have an extra possibility to classify a lease as a financing lease even if it does not meet the transfer of ownership criteria.

If a third party guarantees the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease and the sum of the promised lease payments and the asset's residual value is greater or equal to the fair value of the asset, the lease is to be accounted as a direct financing lease.

Also, the only criteria for off-balance sheet reporting for the lessee is if the lease is of one year or less. Be very clear, this set of criteria is for US GAAP only.

#### Criteria for choosing lease type (IFRS)
For IFRS, the criteria is a bit different.

Firstly, all finance leases for **lessors under IFRS must be sales type lease**.
Direct financing lease is not allowed. If you are told that a lessor reports a finance lease under IFRS, it is implicit that it's a sales type lease.

Next, you should note that IFRS forbids lessees from reporting operating leases. So regardless of whether the risk transfer criteria is met, all lessees have to report their leases as finance leases.

The only exceptions are if the lease term is one year or less, or if the lease asset is of low value. In such cases, the lessee can exclude the lease from its balance sheet.

> GammaLease is a vehicle leasing company which refurbishes old trucks to lease out. GammaLease is a US-based company that reports under US GAAP. 
> 
> Last year, GammaLease refurbished a truck with a total cost of $80,000 to lease to PHZ Transports. The lease is for 5 years, where PHZ will pay GammaLease $30,000 at the end of each year. After the final payment, PHZ will own the truck for no additional payment. The implied interest rate in the lease is 6%. How should GammaLease account for the lease at inception?
> 
> Record a gross profit of$46,371 on the income statement.
> Since the truck is to be held by PHZ and will be owned by them after the final payment, there is sufficient transfer of ownership to the lessee. GammaLease should treat this as a sales-type lease. 
> (N=5, I/Y=6, PMT=$30,000, FV=0) => PV of lease receipts = $126,371
> GammaLease should record a gross profit of $126,371-$80,000=$46,371 in its income statement at inception.

## Pension plans
**Pension** is a deferred compensation earned over time through employee service. Employee is expected some form of compensation when they retire. 

The 2 common types of pension plans are:
- **defined contribution plan** - employee is responsible for taking the decision of which portfolio plan and the employee assumes all the investment risk; employer contribution, expensed in period incurred
- **defined benefit plan** - pension obligation of promise of the payout to the employee every year after the employee's retirement until death; overfunded plan recognised as asset, underfunded plan recognized as a liability

### Defined contribution plan
**Defined contribution plan** is when the firm contributes a certain amount of money to the pension plan. The amount is determined by:
- Employee's age
- Years of service
- Compensation
- Firm's profitability
The employee is responsible for taking the decision of which portfolio plan and the employee assumes all the investment risk. If the investment outcome is bad, the employee has no recourse but to accept the outcome of the retirement.

### Defined benefit plan
**Defined benefit plan** is opposite of the contribution plan, where there is a pension obligation of promise of the payout to the employee every year after the employee's retirement until death. 
The amount is normally determined by:
- Years of service
- Final compensation
- Benefit factor
The employer is responsible and has to make the appropriate investment decision to make the promised amount of benefit plan. In this case, the employer assumes all the investment risks. In reality, most firms set up a trust fund to manage the investment.

The trust is responsible for generating the income and principal growth necessary to payout the amount as they become due. The employer has to make regular contribution to the trust fund so this objective can be achieved. 

### Financial reporting
#### Defined contribution plan
For the defined contribution plan:
- **Income statement** - the **pension expense** is the **employer's contribution**. 
- **Balance sheet** -  there is no pension liability recorded.

#### Defined benefit plan
For the defined benefit plan, since the pension obligation is paid out after the employee's retirement, the amount of pension obligation has to be estimated. 

The estimated amount depends on:
- Employee turnover
- Average retirement age
- Mortality rate
- Years of service
- Final compensation

The pension liabilities applied the appropriate discount rate to discount future benefit to calculate the present value of future pension obligations.

The balance sheet list out the pension asset and pension liabilities. If the fair value of **pension asset > pension liabilities**, it is known as **overfunded** and recorded as **net pension asset**. Conversely, if the fair value of the **pension asset < pension liabilities**, it is known as **underfunded**, and **net pension liabilities**.

There are several elements that can affect the net pension asset/liability: 
- **Service costs** - years of service (the PV of additional benefit earned by an employee over the year)
- **Past service cost** - benefit factor
- **Actuarial gains/losses** - changes of assumptions, actuarial gains/losses are not recorded on the income statement as pension expense.  They are recorded directly to equity as other comprehensive income.
- **Actual return** - calculated through both realised and unrealised gains/losses
- **Interest income** - pension asset $\times$ discount rate
- **Interest expense** - pension liabilities $\times$ discount rate
- **Net interest expense** - net pension liability (asset) $\times$ discount rate
**Note:** This discount rate is chosen by management but should reflect the yield of a highly rated corporate bond.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 23.12.01.png]]

### IFRS and pensions
Under **IFRS**, these elements that affect pension asset/liabilities can be grouped into 3 main components:
- **Service costs** - e.g. service cost, past service cost - recorded on the **income statement** as pension expense.
- **Net interest expense/income** - recorded on the **income statement** as pension expense
- **Remeasurements** - e.g.  actuarial gains/losses, the difference between the actual return and the expected return - recorded into stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (OCI). Under IFRS, remeasurements are not amortised to the income statement over time.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 23.12.29.png]]

### US GAAP and pensions
Under **US GAAP**, these elements that affect pension asset/liabilities  are grouped into 5 main components:
- **service costs** - **pension expense** recognized on the **income statement**
- **past service costs** - taken direct into **stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (OCI)**.
- **interest expense** - pension expense on the **income statement**
- **interest income (i.e. expected return of the plan assets)** - pension expense on the **income statement** (allow different discount rate)
- **actuarial gains/losses** - taken direct into **stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income (OCI)**.

The implication of separating **interest expense** and **interest income** is that **US GAAP** allows the firm to have **different discount rates**.

The **past service cost** and **actuarial gain/losses** that are recorded under OCI are **amortised to pension expense**. This allows firms to smooth their effects on pension expenses over time.

## Solvency ratios
**Non-current liabilities** are primarily the obligations that the firm has to fulfil in the long-term.
**Solvency ratios** is the measurement of the ability of the firm to meet its **long-term obligations**, there are 2 type of ratios which can measure the firms solvency:
- **Debt ratios** - based on balance sheet
- **Coverage ratios** - based on income statement

Other things equal, and ignoring issuance costs, a firm that raises cash by issuing a new bond isÂ _most likely_Â to: increase its leverage ratios and decrease its coverage ratios.
Leverage ratios will increase because debt increases while equity remains unchanged, and (assuming equity is positive) debt increases proportionally by more than assets. Coverage ratios decrease because interest payments increase while EBIT is unchanged.

### Debt ratio
**Debt ratio** uses the values from **balance sheet** to measure the amount of debt relative to the capital structure of the firm. The debt is relative to each of the financial analyst or service provider. 

There are 4 measurement ratios to assess the company's solvency through:
- Debt-to-asset ratio
- Debt-to-capital ratio
- Debt-to-equity ratio
- Financial leverage ratio

Nevertheless, under the CFA curriculum the total debt is:
$$\mathrm{Total\,debt=Short\,term\,interest\,bearing\,debt+Long\,term\,debt}$$
which excludes the accrued expenses and the account payable.

The **debt-to-asset** ratio is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,asset\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,asset}}$$
It calculates the use of debt to finance the asset of the firm. A debt-to-asset ratio of 0.4 indicates 40% of the company's assets are financed with debt. Generally the higher debt means higher risk thus weaker solvency.

The **debt-to-capital** ratio is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,capital\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,debt+Total\,shareholder's\,equity}}$$
where capital is comprised of debt and equity.
Higher debt-to-capital ratio generally indicate higher solvency risks thus weaker solvency.

The **debt-to-equity ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,equity\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,shareholder's\,equity}}$$
Similarly, a higher debt-to-equity ratio generally indicate higher solvency risks thus weaker solvency. A ratio of 1.0 would indicate equal amount of debt and equity, which equals to the debt-to-capital ratio of 0.5.

**Financial leverage ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Leverage\,ratio = \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg. total\,equity}}$$
It indicates the level of equity leveraged to asset. For example, a financial leverage ratio of 3.0 equals to $1 of equity supports $3 of total assets. The higher the financial leverage ratio, the more the company is leveraged.

### Coverage ratio
**Coverage ratio** can examine the **income statement** for more clues on the ability of the company to manage its long-term obligations through its income stream on **income statement**.

**Coverage ratio** measures the **number of times of a company's earnings** can cover its **interest payments**.

The **coverage ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage\,ratio = \frac{EBIT}{Interest\,payments}}$$
thus it is also referred as "times interest earned". High interest coverage indicates high solvency. This offers greater assurance that the company can service its debt from its operating earnings.

The **fixed-charged** includes the lease payments along with interest payments. This ratio measures the number of times a company's earnings can cover the company's interest and lease payments. 

The **fixed-charged coverage ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Fixed\,charge\,coverage\,ratio = \frac{EBIT+Lease\,payments}{Interest\,payments+Lease\,payments}}$$
The higher the fixed-charge coverage, the higher the solvency, which is more meaningful for companies that lease a large portion of their assets.
