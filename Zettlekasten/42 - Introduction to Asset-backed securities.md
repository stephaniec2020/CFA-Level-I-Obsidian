## Asset backed securities 
**Asset backed securities (ABS)** are securities which are backed by assets through a process called securitisation:
- **Securitisation** is the process where the ownership of the assets are transferred to into another separate legal entity, **special purpose vehicle (SPV)**.
- The assets within the SPV back the securitised bonds, which are issued to investors.
- The cash flows generated by the assets are used to make **interest and principal payments** on the securitised bonds.

The pool of the assets are normally named as **collaterals**. 
The **collaterals typically includes**:
- Mortgage loans
- Small business loans
- Auto loans
- Student loans
- Bank loans
- Accounts receivables
- Credit card receivables

Since there are many types of asset-back securities, one can separate them into:
- **Amortising loans** - interest + scheduled principal repayments (e.g. mortgage, auto)
- **Non-amortising loans** - interest only (e.g. small business, accounts receivables) and only required at the end of the loan (balloon payment)

### Benefits of securitisation
For example in mortgage loans, which are normally issued by the bank and in order to get the loan without securitisation, the borrowers has to place deposits, bonds, and stocks to get the loan. 

It is not ideal for the bank as there are intermediary costs borne by the investors, the deposits returns are two low, and exposes more risks to the bank from other business segments such as consumer loans, commercial loans, and financial services.

With securitisation, it can benefit multiple parties.
1. **Reduced intermediation costs** - lower costs for both borrowers and investors
2. **Stronger legal claim on assets** -  loans marked as collaterals vs general claim
3. **Increases the liquidity of bankâ€™s assets** - as securities are actively traded vs holding loan assets in bankâ€™s balance sheet
4. **Banks can lend more** - with proceeds from sale of ABS
5. **Diversification and risk reduction** - pools of borrowers vs concentration on 1 single counter-party
6. Securities that **better match investorâ€™s preferred risk, maturity, and returns characteristics**, as the securities can be subdivided into different tranches to match with the investors risk appetite.

### Example

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.25.25.png]]

### Involved parties in ABS
There are **several involved parties** in the ABS:
- **Company (Seller)** - the entity where the underlying assets originate
- **Debt collector (Servicer)** - the entity that liaises with the borrowers and collects the principal and interest payments for the SPV
- **Issuer/Trust**
- **Investor**
- **Customer**

In some occasions, the seller and the servicer can be the same entity. 

### Structure of ABS
The company might not want to issue the loans as corporate bonds directly to the investors since the company might not have a good credit rating and the interest rate to compensate for the credit risk is high interest cost regardless of the quality of the collateral. 

By organising the collaterals into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), the assets are protected from creditors of originating company. The cash flow are not affected by the events at the company.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.26.10.png]]

The ABS is bankruptcy remote from the company issued this ABS, the creditworthiness of ABS is based on the quality of the collaterals and cash flows, and not affected by the originating company. If the credit rating of the ABS is good, it will incur a lower interest cost to secure the funding.

The other way to improve the credit worthiness is through **tranching**. **Tranches** are multiple classes of securities where it has different claims to the cash flows of the collaterals, the risk is distributed across the class through tranches. The total risk is unchanged but the risk is re-apportioned. 
There are two types of tranching: 
- **credit tranching**
- **time tranching**

#### Credit tranching 
**Credit tranching** uses the **senior/subordinated** structure to **distribute credit risk** amongst tranches.

The tranches will be separated into:
- Senior tranche
- Subordinated tranche A - subordinated tranches absorb credit default losses first (as they occur up to their principal values)
- Subordinated tranche B - subordinated tranches absorb credit default losses first (as they occur up to their principal values)

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.26.46.png]]

If the customers go default, the subordinated tranches absorb the credit default losses first. Therefore, in the event of default, it follows the **waterfall structure**, where each subordinated tranche would receive only the overflow from the more senior tranches.

## Residential mortgage loans
**Residential mortgage loan** is a type of **asset backed securities** where the collateral is the residential real estate. If the borrower default on their loan, the lender has the claim over the collateral, which is the residential property. 

One of the important metric for residential property is the **LTV ratio** (I.e. loan-to-value ratio).

As a lender, with lower LTV ratio is beneficial. Since the borrower has more to lose if it undergoes default. If the property value is high vs the loan amount, the lender is more likely to recover the loan amount if liquidated in the case of default.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.27.23.png]]

In the case of higher LTV ratio, it is riskier to the lender, the borrower has not much to lose if default. If the value of the property drop, the borrower will have negative equity, the LTV ratio >100%, the lender may issue a margin call, if the borrower is unable to pay, the borrower can go into default and the lender is unlikely to recover the loan amount if liquidated.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.27.44.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.28.04.png]]

In the best case scenario of the lender, maintaining a low LTV ratio or matching the borrowerâ€™s profile is important. 

In the US, the high quality borrower is called **prime loans**. It will increase the LTV ratio.

The borrowerâ€™s profile of prime loan:
- Strong employment history
- Good credit history
- Income sufficient to pay obligations

However, if the borrowerâ€™s profile is bad (I.e. lower credit quality), then the LTV ratio is more stringent. The borrowers of lower credit quality or mortgage has lower priority claims on collateral is named **subprime loans**.

### Mortgage terms and structures
Typical mortgage terms and structure varies across countries, there are several key characteristics:
- Maturity
- Interest rate
- Amortisation
- Prepayment
- Foreclosure

#### Maturity
The typical **maturity dates** of mortgage loans in different countries:
- US - 15-30 years
- European countries - 20-40 years
- Japan - 100 years

#### Interest rate
Again, the **interest rate** varies from countries, but there are 4 major ways:
- Fixed rate mortgage - unchanged over the lifetimes of the mortgage
- Adjustable rate mortgage (variable-rate mortgage) - can change over the life of the mortgage, depending on a reference rate (e.g. 360 LIBOR + 1% spread, US T-bill rate)
-  Initial period fixed rate - fixed for some initial period 
	- then go into variable rate mortgage (hybrid mortgage) 
	- then go into another different fixed rate (rollover/renegotiable mortgage) 
- Convertible mortgage - initial interest rate terms (fixed/adjustable), can be changed at borrowerâ€™s option to (adjustable/fixed) for the remaining period.

#### Amortisation
It is important to understand how the principle is being amortised:
1. **Fully amortising loan**
The principal is fully repaid by the maturity of the loan. Normally the initial loan repayment have a larger proportion of the interest payment and small proportion of principal repayment. Then, at the end of the loan, the principal repayment is large, whereas the interest payment component is small.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.28.41.png]]

2. **Partially amortising loan**
The loan is partially amortising if the principal is not fully repaid at the end of the loan period. The interest payment and principal payments are not fully repaid at the end, therefore, it requires a repayment of outstanding principal as a balloon payment.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.29.04.png]]

3. **Interest-only loan**
If no principal repayment for the entire life of the loan, then it is called **interest-only lifetime mortgage**. The balloon payment is repaying the **full principle**. Some loans are a mixture of this with a certain period of being **interest-only**, and the rest of the period as partial/full amortising. 

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.29.22.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.29.53.png | 600]]


#### Prepayment
It is normally allowed with the partial or full repayment of principal, in excess of the scheduled principal repayments, this is referred to a **prepayment**. A prepayment is required when the property is being sold, and the principal has to be repaid and settled the loan. The other occasion of prepayment is when the borrower wants to refinance the mortgage, the remaining of the principal is repaid and proceeds to lower interest rate loan. 

Some house owners pay more as **partial prepayment** to reduce the outstanding principal, and eventually settle the loan prior to the maturity. Some loans do not have penalties for partial repayment, however, some loans do have a penalty for prepayment. A penalty is additional payment that must be made if principal is prepaid. The prepayment penalty compensates the lender for the foregone interest earnings.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.30.19.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.30.30.png]]

#### Foreclosure
A **foreclosure** happens when the borrower default on the mortgage loan. 

If the loan is **non-recourse loan**, the lender has no claim against the assets of the borrower. The **strategic default** is to return the property to the lender. It usually happens when the property value < outstanding loan. The lender has the absorb the loss due to the shortfall.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.30.58.png]]

However, if for a **recourse loan**, the lender has the **right to foreclose** the property and sell it at market price. If there is a **shortfall** from what was owed, the **lender has a claim** against the borrower to make up the shortfall.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.31.14.png]]

Since this is the case, the borrower is more likely to default on the non-recourse loan than the recourse loan. In the European countries, most of the mortgage loans are recourse loans, and in US, it varies across the states.

The only reason a borrower would prefer a recourse loan is when there is no choice, or if the recourse loan is offered at a lower interest rate.

## Residential mortgage-backed securities
Investment grade bond market

The securities backed by **US residential mortgages** are divided into 3 sectors:
- **Federal Agency** - e.g. Government National Mortgage Association "Ginnie Mae" - guaranteed by US government
- **Government-sponsored enterprises (GSE)** - e.g. Federal National Mortgage Association "Fannie Mae", Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation "Freddie Mac" - not backed by government but guaranteed by GSE
- **Non-agency RMBS**

There are differences in terms of riskiness of the RMBS issued by the agency or non-agency:

#### Agency RMBS
**Agency RMBS** includes the federal agency and the government-sponsored enterprise. Since agencies are backed by the US government or the GSE, it reduces the credit risk.

In order to be included in the mortgage pool, there are certain underwriting standards must be fulfilled:
- Max size of loan
- Loan documentation required 
- Max LTV ratio
- Insurance

**"Conforming mortgages"** can then be securitised under Agency RMBS pool.

#### Non-agency RMBS
The **non-agency RMBS** are issued by private entities, they use credit enhancements to reduce credit risk.

The **"non-conforming mortgage"** can only be securitised by private entities for non-agency RMBS.

### Mortgage pass-through securities
For borrowers, once they're conformed to the securitised mortgage, the mortgage can be added to the **mortgage pool**.

The **mortgage pool** can provide meaningful statistics:
- Total principal
- Weighted average coupon (WAC)
- Weighted average maturity (WAM) - life of MBS by it is paid off

Then, the **mortgage pass-through security** uses these statistics to generate the principal amount, interest percentage (WAC), and weighted average maturity (WAM).

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.44.06.png]]

Since the loans are **fully amortising**, in each payment, the **principal** is paid and **interest** is paid. The principal is paid directly to the investors through the **mortgage pass-through security**. However, the interest is not fully paid to the investors, as there is **servicing/insurance fee**. The remaining interest passed to the investors is called **pass-through rate**.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 17.47.21.png]]

#### Prepayment risk
Since the borrowers can decide to prepay the principle+interest at any point in time, it makes the **investor's future cash flow unpredictable**. Therefore, there is a calculation of **expected prepayment rate** to estimate **the average life to maturity**. The actual prepayment rate affected by **market interest rate**.


If the **market interest rate** is **lowered**, the borrowers are likely to **prepay** this loan and **refinance** at a lower rate. Therefore, the actual prepayments > expected prepayment rate. The loan will then have a shorter maturity date, this is known as **contraction risk**.

If the **market interest rate** is high, the borrowers are unlikely to prepay as they have a contractual lower rate than market. Then the loan will have a longer maturity date, this is known as **extension risk**.


#### Expected prepayment rate
The expected prepayment rate is calculated as follows:

The principal is reduced in two ways:
- Under monthly payment schedules (Scheduled repayment)
- Prepayments

The **single monthly mortality (SMM)** rate is calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{SMM=\frac{Prepayments\,for\,the\,month}{Beginning\,principal-Scheduled\,repayments}}$$

**Conditional prepayment rate (CPR)** is the annualised rate. CPR 15% means that approximately 15% of the **outstanding mortgage balance** at the **beginning** of the **year** is expected to be prepaid by the end of the **year**.

In US, the **CPR** is compared to the monthly prepayment benchmark published by the **Public Securities Association (PSA)**. According to historical data, the CPR increase by 0.2% and peak at 6.0%. 

**PSA** is used to estimate the maturity life of the MBS. 
**PSA 100** means that it has the prepayment 100% match with the CPR.
**PSA < 100** means slower prepayments â†’ longer life
**PSA > 100** means faster prepayments â†’ shorter life

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.19.21.png]]

**PSA** is used to estimate the maturity life of the MBS. It is normally set prior to the distribution of the RMBS. The **PSA** would â†‘ if the **market interest rate â†“**, since the borrower are likely to prepayment, the average life would be shorter and subject to contraction risk. However, the **PSA** would â†“ if the **market interest rate â†‘**, since the borrower are unlikely to go on prepayment, then the average life would be longer, and subject to extension risk.

### Collateralise mortgage obligations
#### Time tranching
**Time tranching** distributes **prepayment risk** amongst tranches.

In order to distribute risk, reallocate repayment risk according to investor's preference, contraction risk and extension risk are distributed. The **mortgage pass-through security** is then separated into tranches according to the investor's preference. 

In the early payment, the interest are paid to both tranches, however the prepayments and principals are paid to the tranche where the investor do not mind contraction risk. After tranche A is fully repaid, the tranche is retired, and the later periods of principal are paid to tranche B.
This is known as **collateralised mortgage obligation**.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.25.46.png]]

#### Sequential pay CMO structure
Normally, there is a pool of **mortgage pass-through securities**, and there are several tranches as **collateralised mortgage obligation**, and **sequential pay structure** where one tranche retires once the principal is met. 

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.30.30.png | 600]]

Tranche A is known as the **short tranche**, it provides more protection against **extension risk**. Tranche B is known as the **long tranche**, it provides more protection against **contraction risk**.
Prepayment risk still exists for both tranches, just redistributed.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.36.12.png]]

#### Planned Amortisation Class (PAC) CMO Structure
**Planned Amortisation Class (PAC) CMO Structure** is for investors who would like to be protected against both **extension and contraction risk**.

It is organised through **PAC tranche** and **support tranche** structure. The **support tranche** will be impacted by the **prepayment risk** by **shortening or lengthening the estimated life**, while the **PAC tranche** estimated life will remain as the **expected PSA level** within the **initial collar**.

However, if the PSA level go below or beyond the PSA **initial collar**, then the PAC has to absorb shortening or lengthening of the estimated life, it is known as **broken PAC**.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.40.25.png]]

### Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
**Non-agency RMBS** are all the other RMBS not issued by the agency, such as "Ginnie Mae", "Fannie Mae" and "Freddie Mac". They are issued by private entities and are not guaranteed by the government nor government enterprise.

The credit quality of the RMBS depends on:
- Credit quality of the borrowers
- Loan characteristics (e.g. LTV ratios)
- Credit enhancement

#### Credit enhancement
For the **non-agency RMBS**, **credit enhancements** are required to obtain favourable credit ratings. 

It can be done through **credit tranching**, where the subordinated tranches bear the most credit risk. It works through **shifting interest mechanism,** if prepayments/credit losses decrease credit enhancement of senior tranche.

Other credit enhancement mechanisms include **overcollateralisation** and **reserve account**.

## Commercial Mortgage-backed security
**Commercial Mortgage-backed security** are a group of commercial buildings bundled together as mortgage-backed security, which includes:
- Apartments
- Warehouses
- Shopping centres
- Office buildings
- Healthcare facilities
- Senior housings
- Hotels

Like residential MBS, they are pooled together and sold to CMBS investors (i.e. lenders). The biggest difference compared to RMBS, the real estate investors (i.e. borrowers) pay the mortgage obligations to the CMBS investors. The borrowers relies on the tenants/customers to pay to the borrowers.

The CMBS are normally **non-recourse loans**, the lenders can only have the claim of the property but not other assets of which the borrower owns. If the **property price is lower** than the CMBS loan, then the lender has to bear the **shortfall risk**.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-03 at 18.54.52.png]]

### Credit risk of CMBS
**Credit risk of CMBS** is usually the **commercial property** itself and not the borrower's credit risk since it generates the cash flow through the property. 
There are two key ratios to calculate the credit risk:
- **Debt-to-Service Coverage (DSC) ratio** 
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio**


#### Debt-to-Service Coverage (DSC) ratio
The **Debt-to-Service Coverage (DSC) ratio** calculates the cash flow available to the debt payment (**net operating income**) compared with the **debt service**.

The **Debt-to-Service Coverage (DSC)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DSC = \frac{Net\,operating\,income}{Debt\,service}}$$
where **net operating income (NOI)** = rental income - cash operating expenses; where DSC > 1, means the NOI can cover debt service, it is deemed as creditworthy as the NOI can service the debt. Therefore, the higher the DSC ratio, it is better for the lender.

#### Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio
The **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio** uses the current mortgage amount compared with the current appraised value.

The **LTV** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{LTV = \frac{Current\,mortgage\,amount}{Current\,appraised\,value}}$$

The lower the LTV ratio, the better the quality of the loan, as there is a higher chance of the lender recover the amount in the event of a default, and provide cushioning for the borrowers. The collateral above the loan amount as cushion to lender.

### CMBS structure
In the event of the DSC and LTV ratio do not go beyond the minimum level of the CMBS requirement, there can also be credit tranching to separate the loan into **senior** and **subordinated tranche.**

The senior tranche will be protected, while the losses are absorbed by the most subordinate tranche. The **subordinated tranche** is also known as **equity tranche**, **residual tranche**, **first-loss tranche**.

There are also specific features which are only specific to the CMBS:
- **Call protection** - CMBSs provide investors with considerable call protection that comes either at the structure level or at the loan level, which lowers the prepayment risk
- **Balloon maturity provision**

#### Call protection
**Call protection** **protects** the lenders from **prepayment risk,** and by **placing restrictions** on **prepayments** by borrowers. 
There are two levels of call protection:
- **Structural level**
- **Loan level**

##### Structural level
The structural level follows the "sequential-pay" structure, where the higher-rated tranches are paid off first, and the subordinated tranches have to bear the losses from potential defaults first from the most junior tranches; residual tranche

##### Loan level
There are 4 ways of loan level to protect the lenders from prepayment risk:
- **Prepayment lockout** - borrower prohibited from prepaying for a specified period
- **Prepayment penalty points** - penalty fee (expressed in points) charged when borrowers prepay (1 pt = 1% of prepaid amount)
- **Yield maintenance charge** - Borrower pay penalty to make up interest lost by lender as a result of the prepayment
- **Defeasance** - replicate lost payments due to prepayment using a portfolio of government securities.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.09.58.png]]

#### Balloon maturity provision
**Balloon maturity provision** is a unique form of risk in commercial MBS. Unlike residential mortgages, which are mainly fully amortising loans where the principal. 

Many commercial property mortgages are typically amortised over a period longer than the loan term. For example, payments for a 6-year commercial mortgage may be determined based on a 10 year amortization schedule.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.11.25.png]]

At the end of the loan term, the loan will still have principal outstanding that needs to be paid, **a balloon payment**. **Balloon risk** is the risk of a borrower failing to make the balloon payment, and the borrower is in **default**.

A borrower defaults if:
- unable to refinance the loan
- cannot sell the property to generate sufficient funds to pay off the outstanding principal balance

In such situations, the lender may be forced to extend the term of the loan during a work out period because the life of a loan is extended by the lender during the work out period. **Balloon risk** is a type of **extension risk** for commercial MBS.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.16.17.png]]

## Non-mortgage asset-backed securities
The asset-backed securities pooled together and the pool of the assets are normally named as **collaterals**. 

The **collaterals typically includes**:
- Mortgage loans
- Small business loans
- Auto loans
- Student loans
- Bank loans
- Accounts receivables
- Credit card receivables

Since there are many types of asset-back securities, one can separate them into:
- **Amortising loans** - interest + scheduled principal repayments (e.g. mortgage, auto)
- **Non-amortising loans** - interest only (e.g. small business, accounts receivables) and only required at the end of the loan (balloon payment)

### Amortising loans (Auto loans ABS)
The cash flow from ABS is paid by the borrowers into the pool of auto loans ABS:
- **Principal (scheduled)**
- **Interest** 
- **Prepayments** - car is sold/traded in, stolen/wrecked (using insurance proceeds), repossessed, borrower's choice

There could be **credit enhancement** through:
- the **senior-subordinated structure** - where there are different tranches (i.e. senior and subordinate), where the senior tranche holder could likely recover the loss in the event of default, and the losses are absorbed by the most junior subordinated tranche first.
- **Overcollateralisation** - There are lesser securities issued than the actual loan (i.e. the loans are of $11M, but only issued $10M securities)
- **Reserve account** - where the borrowers are charged more for interest, and the extra interest paid is deposited into the **excess spread account**; which is the first line of protection against losses

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.37.58.png]]

### Non-amortising loans (Credit card receivables ABS)
The **credit card receivables ABS** collaterals:
- Bank credit card receivables
- Retailer credit card receivables
- Company credit card receivables

The cash flow from the borrowers to the collateral includes:
- **Principal repayment**
- **Fees** - includes late fees or annual membership fees
- **Finance charges**  - periodic interest charged to borrower after grace period, where the interest rate can be fixed or floating rate.

Since the credit card receivables collateral is non-amortising, the credit card receivables ABS principal is maintained during **lockout period**. During the **lockout period**, only **fees** and **finance charges** are passed onto ABS investors. 

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.38.16.png]]

If the **principal is repaid** during the **lockout period**, the cash is to buy another credit card receivables for the ABS, to maintain the overall principal value during the lockout period. 

**After the lockout period**, which can last from 18 months to 10 years, the principal repayments to ABS investors after the lockout period, the outstanding principal owed to ABS holders reduced until retirement.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.45.15.png]]

If there are some **specific event** which trigger the "**early amortisation**", the principal repayments are paid to the ABS investors to safeguard the credit quality of ABS. The only way the principal cash flows can be altered is by the triggering of the early amortisation provision.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 16.45.35.png]]

## Collateral debt obligations
**Collateral debt obligations (CDO)** are a pool/collaterals of ABS pooled together and made up of structured financial securities known as structured financed CDO. CDOs can collateralised other CDOs, to form another CDO.

There are different types of collateral debt obligations (CDOs):
- **Structured finance CDO** - includes ABS, and can include other CDOs
- **Collateralised bond obligation (CBO)** - includes corporate bond, emerging market bonds
- **Collateralised loan obligation (CLO)** - includes leveraged bank loan
- **Synthetic CDO** - includes credit default swap (derivative whose value has an inverse relationship with its underlying)

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 17.00.53.png]]

To create a CDO, a **special purpose vehicle (SPV)** should be created such that the assets are bankruptcy remote from their original owners, the funds to purchase the collateral assets for a CDO are obtained from the issuance of debt obligations.

CDOs usually issue three classes of bonds:
- **Senior bonds**, which have the highest credit ratings (around par 70-80% of issue)
- **Mezzanine bonds** with ratings lower than the senior bonds  (around par 10-20% issue)
- **Subordinated bonds**, which are sometimes called the equity or residual tranche.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 17.01.05.png]]

Unlike ABSs, where the main source of returns to the investors is the interest payments from the collateral pool, the returns to a CDO can come from more varied sources. CDOs have a **collateral manager** who **executes trades in the securities** in the collateral pool to **earn a rate of return higher than the aggregate cost** of the bond classes.

For example, if the aggregate cost of the bond obligations is 4.7% and the return of the CDO for the period is 6.2%, the  4.7% goes to pay the senior and mezzanine bondholders and the excess 1.5% goes to the equity tranche holders and the CDO manager.

The percentage of the accrual account is of the par value, therefore, the 0.8% return to tranche holder is actually 8% return for equity tranche. 

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 17.03.57.png]]

## Covered bonds
### ABS vs covered bonds
An asset backed security (ABS) is structured such that the cash flows from a particular asset or pool of assets are specifically set aside for payments to the investors.

A firm achieves this by selling such assets a **special purpose vehicle (SPV)**, which is a**bankruptcy remote entity** such that the assets will no longer be in its balance sheet. However, the relationship works both ways. If the underlying assets of the ABS fail to perform, the holders of the ABS have no recourse from the originating firm.

In some European and Asian countries, financial companies issue **covered bonds**.

**Covered bonds** are similar to ABS, but the underlying assets known as the cover pool remain on the balance sheet of the originating firm and no SPV is created. Likewise, the cover pool is bankruptcy remote. Special legislation protects the assets from the firm's creditors, even though the assets are in the firm's balance sheet.

If the assets in the **cover pool fail to perform**, the originating firm must **replace or augment the non-performing assets** such that it always provides for the obligations of the covered bond, which can be seen as a credit enhancement and lowers the yield of the bond.

Covered bonds are usually single tranched.

![[Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 17.08.46.png]]

There are different types of the covered bonds:
- **Hard bullet** - default if fail to make a scheduled payment
- **Soft bullet** - may postpone scheduled maturity date
- **Conditional pass-through** - converts a pass-through bond on the maturity date if any payments remain due
