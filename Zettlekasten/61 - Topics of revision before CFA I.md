### Probability
For a binomial random variable with five trials and a probability of success on each trial of 0.50, the distribution will be symmetric.

A portfolio manager annually outperforms her benchmark 60% of the time. Assuming independent annual trials, what is the probability that she will outperform her benchmark four or more times over the next five years?

To calculate the probability of four years of outperformance, use the formula
p(x)=P(X=x)=(nx)px(1−p)n−x=n!(n−x)!x!px(1−p)n−x.

Using this formula to calculate the probability in four of five years, n = 5, x = 4, and p = 0.60.

Therefore,
p(4)=5C4 x 0.6^4 x (1−0.6)^1=(5C4)(0.1296)(0.40)=0.2592.
p(5)=5C5 x 0.6^5 x 0.4^1=(5C5)(0.0778)(1)=0.0778.

The probability of outperforming four or more times is p(4) + p(5) = 0.2592 + 0.0778 = 0.3370.

The conditional probability of a fund being a winner in Year 2, given it was a winner in Year 1, is 0.6. If the unconditional probability of a fund being a winner in a given year is 0.5, the probability of a fund being a winner in Year 1 or Year 2, or both, is closest to 0.7.

Because the addition rule is P(W1 or W2) = P(W1) + P(W2) – P(W1W2), where Wi is the probability of being a winner in year i. Since P(W1W2) = P(W2W1) = P(W2|W1)P(W1) = (0.6)(0.5) = 0.3, we have P(W1 or W2) = 0.5 + 0.5 – 0.3 = 0.70.

Probability sampling gives every member of the population an equal chance of being selected.

### Linear regression
The slope of a linear regression is the ratio of the covariance between Y and X to the variance of X," thus slope = 12/9 ≈ 1.33


# Economics

National income = GDP – CCA
Unincorporated business net income, also known as proprietor’s income, is included in personal income.

### The firm and market structure
The long-run competitive equilibrium occurs where MC = AC = _P_ for each company. Equating MC and AC implies 2 + 8Q = 256/_Q_ + 2 + 4Q.

Solving for _Q_ gives _Q_ = 8. Equating MC with price gives _P_ = 2 + 8Q = 66. Any price above 66 yields an economic profit because _P_ = MC > AC, so new companies will enter the market.


- Over time, the market share of the dominant company in an oligopolistic market will _most likely_ decrease.

- Profits are maximised when MR = MC. For a monopoly, MR = _P_(1 – 1/Ep).
- A government entity that regulates an authorised monopoly will _most likely_ base regulated prices on: long run average cost.
- The Herfindahl–Hirschmann Index does not reflect low barriers to entry that may restrict the market power of companies currently in the market.
# Ethical and professional standards
**Standards of conduct** are applied to specific communities or societal groups and identify specific behaviours required of community members. These standards of conduct serve as **benchmarks** for the **minimally acceptable behaviour of community members**. 

**Codes of ethics** serve as a general guide for **how community members should act**; they communicate the organisation’s values and overall expectations regarding member behaviour, but they do not identify specific behaviours required of community members. 

**Laws and regulations** are rules of conduct defined by governments and related entities about obligatory and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and entities under their jurisdiction.

Decision makers who use a **compliance approach** are most likely to **oversimplify decision making and can become another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations**.

The investment management profession and investment firms must be interdependent to maintain trust. Employers and regulators have their own standards and practices, which may differ from regulations and standards set by professional bodies.

**Ethical decision-making framework**:
- **Identify** - important facts, stakeholders and duties to the stakeholders, applicable ethical and legal requirements
- **Consider** - situational influences/behavioural biases, guidance from trusted sources, consult compliance or legal counsel, guidance from firm's policies/code and standards
- **Decide and act** - arrive at the most ethical decision and act on it
- **Reflect** - assess decision and outcomes, consider whether the decisions had their intended results



As stated in the revised 11th edition, the Standards of Professional Conduct: address the risks and limitations of recommendations being made to clients.

Within the **Standards of Practice Handbook**, CFA Institute addresses ethical principles for the profession in the following Standards: **individual professionalism**; **integrity in capital markets**; **responsibilities to clients**, **responsibilities to employers**; **ethics involved in investment analysis, recommendations, and actions**; and **possible conflicts of interest**.

Certain examples:
**Employers should compare personal transactions of employees with those of clients on a regular basis regardless of the existence of a requirement by any regulatory organisation**. Such comparisons ensure that employees’ personal trades do not conflict with their duty to their clients, and the comparisons can be conducted in a confidential manner.

Fiduciary duty on issues relating to corporate governance or to soft dollars is primarily addressed by Standard III(A), Loyalty, Prudence, and Care. 

when possible, **prior to accepting bonuses or gifts from clients, ”members and candidates should disclose to their employers such benefits offered by clients.”** 

Further, **the “Use of simulated results should be accompanied by full disclosure as to the source of the performance data.” Therefore, the use of simulated results must be disclosed and must not be omitted.**

**Standard IV (B), Additional Compensation Arrangements, “Members and Candidates must not accept gifts, benefits, compensation, or consideration that competes with or might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with their employer’s interest unless they obtain written consent from all parties involved.”**

**Standard V (A)–Diligence and Reasonable Basis** if they rely on the research of another party who exercised diligence and thoroughness. Because Bishop’s opinion did not agree with the final report, **disassociating her from the report is one way to handle this difference between the analysts**.

**Standard V (C), Record Retention**, "in the absence of regulatory guidance or firm policies, CFA Institute recommends maintaining records for **at least seven years**." 

After a firm presents a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant performance, the firm must present an additional year of performance each year, **building up to a minimum of 10 years of GIPS-compliant performance**.
### Money weighted rate of return 
Money - CF -> IRR
### Time weighted rate of return (TWRR)
**TWRR** is calculated by the geometric mean of portfolio (i.e. TWRR = geometric mean of portfolio).
HPR on per share basis within the time

The formula of **time-weighted rate of return (TWRR)** is as follow:
$$TWRR=\sqrt[n]{(1+R_1) \times (1+R_2) \times ... \times (1+R_n)}$$
where $R_{1\,to\,n}$: calculated through the holding period return (HPR) which previously discussed


# Economics
trade deficit (the current account) (X-M)
(X-M) = T-G+S-I

For a monopolist, this occurs at a lower output level than for a purely competitive firm, because the monopolist has a marginal revenue curve that falls below the demand curve, while the purely competitive firm has a marginal revenue curve that lies along the demand curve.

The law of diminishing returns states that as more variable resources are a production process combined with a fixed input, output will eventually increase at a decreasing rate. In the short run, as the quantity produced rises, costs rise at an increasing rate.

One-year forward points = (one year forward rate – spot rate) × 10,000 
# Financial statement analysis (FSA)

"The notes (also sometimes referred to as footnotes) that accompany the four financial statements are required and are an integral part of the complete set of financial statements"

(Cash + short-term marketable investments + receivables) divided by average daily cash expenditures is known as the defensive interval ratio. The defensive interval ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures the firm's ability to pay cash expenditures in the absence of external cash flows, but does not directly measure profitability. 

EBIT / average total assets is one variation of the return on assets ratio. **Return on assets (ROA)** is a **profitability** ratio that measures the **efficiency** of managing assets and generating profits.
### Balance sheet 
Efficiency ratio = total asset turnover
Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require companies to capitalise the interest that accrues during the construction of capital assets for their own use.

If a company chooses to write down inventory, which ratio is most likely to improve?
Total asset turnover should improve, as the numerator (sales) would not be affected while the denominator (total assets) would be lower. Profitability ratios and the debt-to-equity ratio would be worse due to lower profits and lower equity due to the inventory writedown.
### Income statement
**US GAAP** - everything is CFO except dividend received is CFI; dividends paid are CFF only.
**IFRS** - interest expense/received CFO or CFI

**Direct method** - direct method cash flow statement presents specific operating cash flows by source and use.

**CFO calculation:** (beware of cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers)
$$\mathrm{CFO = Revenue_{adjusted}- COGS_{adjusted}}$$
$$\mathrm{Cash\,received\,from \,customers = Revenue + \Delta Accounts\, receivable}$$

$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,to\,suppliers = COGS + \Delta Inventory + \Delta Accounts\,payable}$$

Therefore, the company’s operating cash flow = $40 – $22 – Cash paid for salaries – Cash paid for interest – Cash paid for taxes = $40 – $22 – $6 – $2 – $4 = $6 million.

“FFO (Funds from operations) to debt = FFO / Total debt... FFO = funds from operations, defined as EBITDA minus net interest expense minus current tax expense (plus or minus all applicable adjustments).”

**Cash inflow from sale**:
$$\mathrm{
Selling\,price - BV= gain/loss\,on\,sale}$$
The amount of loss is given—$2M. To calculate the book value of the equipment sold, find the historical cost of the equipment and the accumulated depreciation on the equipment.

Beginning balance of equipment of $100 million plus equipment purchased of $10 million minus ending balance of equipment of $105 million equals the historical cost of equipment sold, or $5 million.

Beginning accumulated depreciation of $40 million plus depreciation expense for the year of $8 million minus ending balance of accumulated depreciation of $46 million equals accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold, or $2 million.

Therefore, the book value of the equipment sold was $5 million minus $2 million, or $3 million.

Because the loss on the sale of equipment was $2 million, the amount of cash received must have been $1 million.

Retained earning difference = net income

**Indirect method** - net income + depreciation expense

> Using the indirect method, CFO = Net income 25 + increase in accounts payable 20 + increase in deferred taxes 5 – profit on sale of equipment 15 = $35.
> 
> Increases in accounts payable and deferred taxes are sources of operating cash that are not included in net income and must be added. Profit on sale of equipment is a CFI item that must be removed from net income.
> 
> No adjustment needs to be made for cash payment of dividends (CFF), sale of preferred stock (CFF), or purchase of land (CFI) because they are not included in net income. Only the profit on sale of equipment, not the full proceeds from sale, is included in net income.

**Common percentage cash flow statement** - An appropriate method to prepare a common-size cash flow statement is to show each line item on the cash flow statement as a **percentage of net revenue**. An alternative way to prepare a statement of cash flows is to show each item of cash inflow as a **percentage of total inflows** and each item of cash outflows as a **percentage of total outflows**.

**Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{FCFF = CFO-FC_Inv+Interest\times(1-T)}$$
$$\mathrm{FCFF = NI+NCC-FC_Inv-WC_Inv+Interest\times(1-T)}$$

**Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)** is as follows:
As interest is only paid to creditors, FCFE does not include interest in the equation.
However, the net borrowing should be included in the calculation.
$$\mathrm{CFF\,from\,debt\,issued = Net\,borrowing+Debt\,redeemed}$$

Therefore, the **free cash flow to the equity (FCFE)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{FCFE = CFO-FC_Inv+Net\,borrowing}$$

**Cash to income** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,to\,income=\frac{CFO}{Operating\,income}}$$

both IFRS and US GAAP specify that the results of **discontinued operations** should be reported separately from continuing operations...When a company disposes of or establishes a plan to dispose of one of its component operations and will have no further involvement in the operation, the **income statement reports separately the effect of this disposal as a “discontinued” operation under both IFRS and US GAAP.**

### Deferred taxes
The **income tax expense** can be presented in this equation:
$$\mathrm{Income\,tax\,expense=Tax\,payable+\Delta DTL-\Delta DTA}$$
DTL: represents a future liability.

When accounting standards require an asset to be expensed immediately but tax rules require the item to be capitalised and amortised, the company will most likely record a deferred tax asset.

A **lower statutory tax rate would increase net income on the income statement**, and because the company has a net deferred tax liability, the net liability position on the balance sheet would also improve (be smaller).

**Tax credits that directly reduce taxes are a permanent difference**, and permanent differences do not give rise to deferred tax.
# Corporate issuer
Value chain analysis most likely involves identifying the: specific activities carried out by the firm.

To finance working capital, which of the following sources provides the most financial flexibility to companies? Long-term debt - because longer term-securities "are generally more costly to the firm, but they can provide the firm with increased financial flexibility."

Business risk = sales and operation risk

cost of preferred shares

Yield to maturity is an appropriate estimate of a firm's before-tax cost of capital. Its after-tax cost of capital may be estimated as YTM × (1 – tax rate) and will be less than the before-tax cost of capital, as long as the firm faces a positive tax rate. 
# Portfolio Management

# Equity Investment

An analyst should form peer groups of companies that have similar business activities, drivers of demand and costs, and access to capital. Companies in the same industry or sector and companies at the same stage of the industry life cycle are not necessarily comparable for equity valuation purposes.

When computing any price-weighted index, the denominator must be adjusted to take stock splits into account.

An index based on company fundamentals, for example on earnings or book value, will assign more weight to stocks with low P/E or price-to-book ratios compared to a value-weighted index. This is similar to managing an equity portfolio using a value strategy.


# Fixed income

Clean price
### Reinvestment risk and price risk

Duration is measured by annual basis

### Effective duration
- The **presence of an embedded put option reduces the effective duration of the bond, especially when rates are rising**. 
- **Effective duration** is used in portfolio duration. A limitation of calculating a bond portfolio’s duration as the weighted average of the yield durations of the individual bonds is that this measure implicitly **assumes a parallel shift to the yield curve** (all rates change by the same amount in the same direction)

### Money duration
The equation of money duration **based on full price of bond position** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Money\,duration=Modified\,duration\times Full\,price\,bond\,position}$$
where the full price bond position is the holdings of the investor; money duration: if YTM increase by 1%, then the bond position change by _money duration_.
#### Per 100 of par value
The equation of money duration **per 100 of par value** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Money\,duration=Modified\,duration\times Full\,price\,of\,bond\,per\,\$100\,of\,par}$$
where the full price of bond per \$100 of par value ($\mathrm{\frac{PV}{par\,value}}$ $\times$ 100); and if YTM increase by 1%, every $100 par change by _money duration_ $\times$ 1%. Calculate the change in bond position remembering that current par change is measured every $100. 

#### Price value per basis point (PVBP)
**Money duration of PVBP**, also known as **dollar duration**, provides an approximate **absolute change** in a bond's price for a **1bp change** in yield to maturity (YTM).
The equation of money duration **Price value per basis point (PVBP)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{PVBP=\frac{(V_{-}-V_{+})}{2}}$$
where 1 bp is 0.01%; and the money duration should be calculated per 100 par and convert all the values to per 100 par. 

# Derivatives

### Pricing and Valuation of Interest Rates and Other Swaps
- A pay-fixed swap counter-party will realise an MTM gain if implied forward rates rise.
- A receive-fixed swap counter-party will make a net payment if the initial market reference rate sets above the fixed swap rate.
- A receive-fixed swap has a risk and return profile similar to that of a _long_ fixed-rate bond position.
- Since the par swap rate represents the fixed rate at which the present value of fixed and future cash flows equal one another, we first solve for the implied forward rate per period using zero rates, then discount each implied forward rate back to the present using zero rates, and solve for _s3_ to get 3.605%.
- **Swaps have both a price and a value. Price in the context of a swap is a reference to the fixed-rate payment on the swap, which is constant over time. The value of a swap is zero at initiation but can change over the life of the swap as market interest rates change.**
### Interest rate futures vs Forward rate agreement (FRA)
There are differences of **interest rate futures** and **forward rate agreement (FRA)**:

|Features|Interest rate futures|FRA|
|---|---|---|
|Cash settlement|based on settlement date|discounted by MRR|
|Long|expect MRR ↓|expect MRR ↑ (floating  rate receiver)|
|Short|expect MRR ↑|expect MRR ↓ (fixed rate receiver)|

When **interest rates are negatively correlated** with the price of the underlying, the mark-to-market feature of futures means that when additional margin deposits are required (lower price of the underlying), interest cost is higher. When margin can be withdrawn from the account (higher price of the underlying), the interest earned on the cash withdrawn will be lower; **which will cause the price of future vs forwards to be different.**

Although a swap may be viewed as a series of forward contracts expiring at various times where one party agrees to make a fixed payment and receive a variable payment, with swaps, the fixed payments are the same and are established at initiation. However, the prices of the implicit forward contracts embedded in a swap will not be equal.

### Pricing and Valuation of Options
The **put exercise price**, _X_ (equal to _F0_(_T_) in this case), represents the _upper_ bound on the **put value**, while the _lower_ bound is the greater of the present value of the exercise price minus the spot price and zero:

$$\mathrm{Max(0,X(1+r)^{−(T−t)}−S_t)<p_t≤X}$$

The option price is equal to the sum of the exercise value and the time value. **A call option's exercise value** is equal to the greater of zero and the spot price minus the present value of the exercise price:
$$\mathrm{Max(0,S_t-X(1+r)^{−(T−t)})}$$
$$=\mathrm{Max(0, INR325 − INR300.84(1.04)^{-0.25})}$$
The **time value** is equal to the **call price minus the exercise value**, or INR 19.31 (= INR46.41 − INR27.10).

-  An increase in the volatility of the underlying share price will increase both the upfront premium received on the sold call option and the premium paid on the purchased put option.
-  A European call option is worth less the more dividends are paid by the underlying.
