## Sources of fund
The company have various sources of sourcing capital and ways to manage liquidity:
- **Internal financing** - e.g. generating its own operating cash flows, increasing working capital efficiency, (i.e. account payables, receivables, and inventory) or convert liquid asset, and marketable securities into cash for its short-term financing needs.
- **Financial intermediaries** - e.g. financial intermediaries, which can be banks or non-bank entities.
- **Capital markets** - commercial paper, debt, common stock, and preferred stock.
- **Others method** - leasing

### Internal financing
In essence, a company can source for funds internally by generating its **own operating cash flow**. These are the company's after-tax operating cash flows, minus interest payments and dividend payments. A company with higher, more predictable after-tax operating cash flows has greater ability to internally finance itself.

Other method such as increasing working capital efficiency, (i.e. account payables, receivables, and inventory) or convert liquid asset, and marketable securities into cash for its short-term financing needs.

#### Working capital efficiency (Accounts receivables)
**Accounts receivables** are amounts owed by customers. The sooner a company can collect what it is owed the less it's need to finance the operations in some other way.

#### Working capital efficiency (Accounts payables and trade credit)
**Accounts payable** are amounts owed by the company to suppliers of goods and services.
**Trade credit** is a spontaneous form of credit that arises from the terms of payment where suppliers usually extend a grace period for payments to be made.

e.g. If the supplier extends net-60 terms to the company, the payment is due 60 days from the invoice date (i.e. as a 60-day interest-free loan extended by the supplier)

Sometimes suppliers may offer discounts as a reward for early payment. e.g., a 2/10 net-60 term means that the payment is due in 60 days, but a 2% discount is applied if the payment is made within 10 days from the invoice date.

If we take the discounted amount as the base, we can see it as a form of interest-free loan from the supplier for the first 10 days. After 10 days, the full payment is required, so we can see the discount as an interest to be paid. To the company, this can be seen as a short-term unsecured loan from the supplier. If the cost is cheaper than other sources of short-term loans, the company may want to make the payment later instead of borrowing.

#### Working capital efficiency (Inventory)
When the inventory is sold, potential cash receipts are a source of funds, but the implications on a firm's cash position go beyond that.

Many companies use a **Just-in-Time inventory system**, which means the inventory arrives from suppliers when it is needed. Investing in and holding inventory costs money, so companies would prefer not to put a lot of money into inventory when that money could be used for more productive means. This approach makes the supply chain much more efficient but it also increases the risk of a critical component or item being out of stock when needed.

#### Working capital efficiency (Marketable securities)
Marketable securities are financial instruments such as stocks and bonds of other entities that can be quickly sold in the market and converted to cash. Companies can sell some of the marketable securities that they hold if they need funds for any reason, such as when making a capital expenditure.

### Financial intermediaries
**Financial intermediaries** can be banks or non-bank entities.
For banks, there are several types of credit/loans depending on the corporate credibility:
- **Lines of credit** - rank according to the least to the most reliable (uncommitted LOC, committed LOC, revolving LOC)
- **Secured ("Asset-based") loans** - may have to pledge assets as collateral 

### Lines of credit
**Lines of credit** are typically unsecured loans and the interest charges are stated in terms of a short-term reference rate, such as LIBOR, or the US prime rate, plus a margin for the credit risk.
e.g. reference + margin

**Lines of credit** are typically given to large financially sound companies. 
There are several types of LOC, starting with the least reliable:
- **Uncommitted LOC** - Bank can refuse to lend if circumstances change, therefore companies should not rely on it for short-term financing needs.
- **Committed LOC** - Bank commits to lend up to a certain amount for a period of time (typically $\le$ 1 year);  typically require the borrower to pay a commitment fee to the bank as a form of compensation for setting aside the amount for borrower.
- **Revolving LOC** - aka "revolver", bank commits larger sum for multiple years, borrow and repay as needs change over time. It can be listed on a firm's financial statements in the footnotes as a source of liquidity.

### Secured (asset-based) loans
Smaller companies or companies with weaker credit may have to pledge assets as collateral under a **secured (asset-based) loan** from a bank:
- **Receivables** - short-term loans
- **Inventory** - short-term loans
- **Fixed assets** - short-term loans

#### Receivables
**Receivables** can be collateralised against through:
- **Assignment arrangement** - the firm **assigns** its receivables to the bank, the firm still services the receivables (i.e. make collections) and remains responsible for any receivables that are not paid.
- **Factoring arrangement** - the firm's receivables are **sold** to the bank at a **discount** from their face values. The **discount** will depend on how long it is until the receivables are due, the credit worthiness of the firm's credit customers and the firm's collection history on its receivables. "Factor", which is the buyer of the receivables, takes on the responsibility for collecting receivables and the credit risk of the receivables.

### Non-bank financial intermediaries
**Non-bank financial intermediaries** includes web-based lenders, which typically lend to small to medium-sized firms and charge **commissions** and **fees** in addition to **interest**.

### Capital market sources
**Capital market sources financing** through:
- **Commercial paper** - short term financing source
	- **Unsecured debt**
	- Issued by **large** and well-rated companies
	- **Lower interest rate** than bank loans
	- Require **back up line of credit** to assure investors
	- Sold directly to investors or through dealers
- **Debt** - long term financing source
	- **Fixed** interest rate until maturity
	- Payment **priority** over equity holders
	- Interest paid on debt is **tax deductible**
	- Interest rate **depends on market interest rate, creditworthiness, collateral**
- **Common stock** - long term financing source
	- Issue in **public** markets or **privately**
	- Dividends (non-tax deductible) at management's discretion
	- There are also convertible preferred stock and convertible bonds which can be converted into common stock
- **Preferred stock** - long term financing source
	- Qualities of both debt (regular fixed payments) and equity (no maturity)
	- Dividend payments on preferred shares have priority over common stock dividends, but lower priority than interest payments on debt
	- Dividends are non-tax deductible

### Lease payments as a financing method
Instead of borrowing to make a lump sum purchase, the firm promises to **make regular lease payments** in exchange for the right to use an asset over a specified period. **Leasing** can be viewed as a bundle of **financing** and **purchase** in a single package.

### Factors affecting financing decisions
There are major 2 types of factors which can affect the financing decisions, which is **firm-specific** and **macroeconomic**.

The **firm-specific** factors are as follows:
- **Company size**
- **Volatility of operating cash flows**
- **Quality of assets available as collaterals**
- **Management of maturities**
- **Short-term interest costs**
- **Currency risks**
- **Cost of financial distress**
- **Agency costs**
- **Flotation costs**

The **macroeconomic** factors are as follows:
- **Taxation** - interest payments on debt are tax deductible, there is the advantage of issuing debt over equity, particularly for companies whose marginal tax rate is high.
- **Inflation expectations**
- **Government policy**
- **Monetary policy**

#### Company size
The **company size** can be one of the determining factor of financing. 
**Large companies** with strong operating cash flows:
- rely more heavily on **internal financing**
- their **credibility** usually allows them to source additional funds from capital markets at low cost

Smaller companies:
- **might not have the positive and predictable cash flows** needed to meet fixed periodic debt payments
- tend to depend on private equity financing

#### Volatility of operating cash flows
High levels of uncertainty in cash flows can make servicing debt obligations challenging.
Companies with unpredictable cash flows:
-  tend to use little debt financing
- rely primarily on equity financing

#### Quality of assets as collateral
Quality of assets available as collaterals:
- Real property and equipment are good collateral for mortgages (MBS) and asset backed bond (ABS).
- Assets that are unique, highly specialized and intangible might not be valuable as collaterals. So debt financing using such assets as collaterals are rare.

#### Management of maturities
**Management of maturities** between asset and liabilities.
When issuing debt to fund specific assets, companies tend to match the maturity of the debt to the useful life of the asset.

However, some companies may choose to issue short-term debt to fund long-term assets. because short-term interest costs tend to be lower than long-term interest costs.
If short-term rates are expected to stay low for an extended period, some companies may prefer to finance with short-term debt and continually refinance with new short-term debt.

However, there is **rollover risk**, where short-term rate increases when refinancing, or the company could not refinance at all due to market or company-specific conditions.

#### Currency risk
Currency risks for companies whose revenues are in one currency and debt repayment is in a different currency. If the foreign currency strengthens, the company may have difficulty repaying its debt. Short-term debt in foreign currencies can be hedged using derivatives.

#### Taxation
Interest payments on debt are tax deductible. There is the advantage of issuing debt over equity, particularly for companies whose marginal tax rate is high. 

#### Inflation
Inflation expectations can also affect financing decisions. If inflation is expected to be high, long-term fixed-rate debt becomes more attractive to issuers because future debt payments will be less in real terms.

On the other hand, uncertainty about future inflation rates can make issuing long-term fixed-rate debt riskier, and issuing short-term or floating-rate debt more attractive.

#### Government policy
Policy-wise, some governments make provisions for loans to specific industries at lower interest rates to stimulate the economy or to grow certain sectors.

The government could also provide loan guarantees to the lenders such that lenders would agree to lend greater amounts and at lower interest rates.

#### Monetary policy
Central banks around the world have at times set benchmark interest rates to historically low and even negative levels to stimulate economies. Access to capital is made much cheaper for companies. Many companies use the opportunity to issue debt at low rates, refinance existing debt, and repurchase common stock. All these have an effect of increasing leverage in companies, thus stimulating the economy.

## Managing and measuring liquidity
### Liquidity management
**Liquidity** is the ability of a company in meeting its short-term **obligations**. 
**Short-term obligations** include:
- Payments to vendors/suppliers (including staff salary and rent)
- Interest payments to creditors
- Repayment of debt that is due soon

**Liquidity management** is the process of a company to meet its needs. This is especially crucial for companies which are entitled to financial situations to ensure **firm solvency**. In general, a company's liquidity position is healthy if it can get cash to flow in more quickly
and flow out more slowly.

The sources of liquidity vary from firm to firm, but they can generally be categorised as **primary** and **secondary** sources. Healthy firm should use **primary sources** to fund for **short-term obligations**. 

**Primary sources** of liquidity are meant for use in normal day-to-day operation:
- **Cash and cash equivalents**
	- Sales of goods/services
	- Collection of receivables
	- Cash from short-term investments
- **Short-term funding**
	- Trade credit from vendors
	- Lines of credit from banks
- **Cash flow management system**
	- Process of collection payments, if it is effective and centralised â‡’ more cash in shorter period of time

A firm that's not able to receive sufficient cash from its primary sources may have to turn to secondary sources for additional funds.

**Secondary source** of liquidity include:
- **Liquidating assets** (short term or long lived assets) - the value depends much on how desperately the company needs the cash.
- **Renegotiate debt agreements** - If successful, this can help relieve liquidity pressures from high interest or principle payments.

If all else fails, the company may have to file for **bankruptcy** or **restructure the company**.
Companies should avoid drawing from secondary sources for their liquidity needs, as these can change the company's financial structure and operations significantly.

### Factors that affect liquidity position
There are factors that weaken a company's liquidity position (i.e. **drags and pulls** on liquidity). A **drag** on liquidity is when cash receipts are delayed or reduced; where as pull on liquidity is when there is an accelerate cash outflows. 

Some major factors of **drag on liquidity** include:
- **Uncollected receivables** -high number of days of receivables, high levels of bad debt expenses
- **Obsolete inventory** - take longer to sell, can require sharp price discounts, storage costs 
- **Tight credit environment** - ST debt becomes more scarce and expensive

On the other hand, **pulls on liquidity** include:
- **Early payments to vendors** - better to conserve cash if there's no benefit to early payment.
- **Lower credit limits by suppliers** - squeeze on liquidity 
- **Reduce the line of credit by banks** - requiring the repayment of some of the outstanding balances

Companies should be aware of the drag and pull factors that can weaken their liquidity position, and build in sufficient buffers to handle such circumstances.

### Measures of liquidity
### Liquidity ratio
**Liquidity ratio** is the ability to satisfy **short-term** obligations, whether the liquid assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory) can satisfy the current liabilities (due within a year). 

There are three ways to calculate the ratio:
- **Current ratio**
- **Quick ratio**
- **Cash ratio**

The **current ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Current\,ratio = \frac{Current\,assets}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
where the assumptions are made that receivables and inventory are liquid. When the current ratio is high, it indicates a greater ability to meet short-term obligations, while low current ratio, indicates less liquidity and reliance on CFO or external financing.

The **quick ratio** is as follows:$$\mathrm{Quick\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities+Receivables}{Current\,liabilities}}$$where **inventory is excluded** from the equation since it is not easy to solve whether it is current or not.

Stricter ratio which excludes receivables as well, the **cash ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
The cash ratio normally represents a reliable measure of liquidity in a crisis situation. Only **highly marketable short term (short-term debt instruments which are liquid and of good credit quality) investments and cash** are included.

### Turnover ratios
There are 3 turnover ratios to measure how efficient a firm is in utilising its current assets:
- **Inventory turnover** - 365/inventory turnover â‡’ Days of inventory on hand
- **Receivable turnover** - 365/receivables turnover â‡’ Days sales outstanding
- **Payable turnover** - 365/payable turnover â‡’ Days payable outstanding
**Note:** All uses 365 to transform to days, and to use those metrics (i.e DIO, DSO, DPO) to calculate CCC.

**Inventory turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its inventory:
$$\mathrm{Inventory\,turnover=\frac{COGS}{Avg.Inventory}}$$
where COGS: cost of goods sold.

**Days of inventory on hand (DOH or DIO)**, is an extension of the **inventory turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DOH=\frac{365}{Inventory\,turnover}}$$
Higher DOH or DIO means that inventory is not getting sold quickly, which can be overstocking or slowing of sales                                                                                                                                                                                       
**Receivables turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its receivables:
$$\mathrm{Receivables\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.Receivable}}$$
**Days sales outstanding (DSO)**, is an extension of the **receivables turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DSO=\frac{365}{Receivables\,turnover}}$$
A high DSO (>45 days) mean that the firm is not collecting the money and a low one means the firm is efficiently collecting it.

**Payables turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its payables (trade credit):
$$\mathrm{Payables\,turnover=\frac{Purchases}{Avg.Payables}}$$
where $\mathrm{Purchases = Ending\,inventory-Beginning\,inventory+COGS}$.
**Note:** **COGS** is an income sheet item, **Payables** is a balance sheet item. Therefore, payables turnover is not a pure ratio.

**Number of days payable** **(days payable outstanding, DPO)**, is an extension of the **payable turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Num\,of\,days\,payable=\frac{365}{Payables\,turnover}}$$
- It tells how quickly you pay the suppliers, ideally, DSO < DPO, this means the firm is getting paid BEFORE paying the firm's suppliers

### Operating and cash conversion cycles
 "Cash is King and Cash flow is Queen" â‡’ managing both well will result in better decisions and increased profitability.
**Cash conversion cycle** (CCC) means the time between the outlay of cash and the collection of cash, or simply, CCC is how long it takes from investment (purchase of inventory) to a collection of revenue (cash in hand).

$$\mathrm{Cash\,conversion\,cycle =DIO+DSO-DPO}$$
where lower CCC â‡’ Shorter period to finance inventory and receivable â‡’ higher liquidity 
while longer CCC â‡’ Longer period to finance inventory and receivable â‡’ lower liquidity
DOH: Days of inventory outstanding (time in inventory); DSO: Days sales outstanding (time as a receivable); DPO: Days payable outstanding (time to pay bills) 

CCC can be shortened through:
- decreasing the amount of time of holding onto inventory
- decreasing how long it takes to bill and then collect receivables
- increasing ho quickly you pay accounts payables

- The other way to payoff the expenses are from its assets
- **Defensive interval ratio** measure how long the company can continue to pay its expenses through its liquid assets
$$\mathrm{Defensive\,interval\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities-Receivables}{Avg. daily\,expenditure}}$$
where if the defensive interval ratio of 10, means that the company can expend for 10 days based on the assumption of no cash inflow.
High ratio â‡’ high liquidity; Low ratio â‡’ need sufficient cash inflow

## Evaluating short-term financing choices
The **objective** of **short term financing management** is to maintain a **sound liquidity position** for a firm.

The key strategy is to:
- ensure sufficient capacity to **handle peak cash needs**
- to **maintain sufficient sources** of short term funding
- to ensure interest costs are market competitive

### Factors that affect financing management strategies
The effectiveness of the strategy can be affected by a number of factors:
- **Size and creditworthiness of the company**
- **Diversity of sources**
- **Flexibility of borrowing options**
- **Legal and regulatory**

#### Size and credit worthiness of the company
Larger firms with good credit scores tend to be able:
- to borrow at lower interest costs
- have a larger variety of sources
- have access to commercial paper and bankers acceptances (whereas smaller companies tend not to have these benefits)

#### Diversity of sources
Borrowers should not be too reliant on one lender or form of borrowing if the amount is very large. Also, borrowers should not just stick to the cheapest form of borrowing as certainty that the line of credit is available can be equally important.

#### Flexibility of borrowing options
Flexibility means the ability to manage maturities efficiently. There should not be any big days when significant amounts of loans mature at the same time.

To effectively manage loan maturities, borrowers need active maturity management, awareness of the market conditions, and the ability to prepay loans when unexpected cash receipts occur.

#### Legal and regulatory
Some countries impose constraints on how much a company can borrow, and under what terms it can borrow. In some developed countries, utilities and banks might be restricted in how much they can borrow and the kind of borrowing they can engage in.

### Financing management strategies
There are two types of strategies:
- **Passive source management** -  involve minimal activity with one type of borrowing and with little planning. Borrowings are routinely rolled over without much shopping for the best rates
- **Active source management** - more flexible, reflecting planning, reliable forecasting of future cash needs, and seeking the best deal. **Matching strategies** where the borrowings are scheduled to mature when large cash receipts are expected. These receipts can pay back the loan, so the company does not have to invest the funds at a potentially lower rates than the borrowing cost, thereby creating unnecessary costs.
