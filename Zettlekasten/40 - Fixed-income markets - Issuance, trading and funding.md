## Overview of global fixed income markets
### Classification of global bond markets
The bonds are classified by:
- Issuer
- Taxable status
- Credit quality
- Currency
- Geography
- Original maturity
- Coupon structure
- Indexing

#### Issuer
There are mainly 3 types of issuers:
- Government sector - supranational (e.g. World bank, IMF), sovereign national governments (e.g. US Treasuries, UK GILTS, Singapore), non-sovereign (local) governments (e.g. California muni, Toronto), related government entities/Quasi-government (e.g. Fannie Mae, government agencies)
- Corporate sector - Financial (banks, insurance companies), non-financial companies
- Structured finance sector - special legal entities (e.g. create asset-backed securities)

#### Taxable status
There are several taxable status:
- Non-taxable - Municipal bond e.g. California municipal bonds - lower yields than taxable bonds
- Interest only - e.g. UK Gilts are exempted from capital gain tax
- Taxable - most of the bonds are taxable

#### Credit quality
There are three agencies for rating bonds:
- Moody's
- S&P
- Fitch

Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by both S&P and Fitch are considered as non-investment grade, high-yield junk bond. It is an important distinction as some institutions are prohibited in investing in non-investment grades bonds.

#### Currency
Another way of classifying bonds is through its currency denomination:
- Euros
- US dollars
- Others

The bonds might have different yields due to subject to the different market's interest rate.

#### Geography
Distinguished bonds with different currency and market:
|Type | Currency | Market |
|----|----|----|
|Domestic|Local | Local|
|Foreign|Foreign | Foreign|
|US - "Yankee"|Local | Foreign (AUS trading USD in US market)|
|AU - "Kangaroo"|Local | Foreign (US trading AUD in AUS market)|
|Eurobond|Local/Foreign |Eurobond|

The domestic and foreign bonds are registered bond, where the ownership is recorded.

**Eurobond**:
- named after the currency in which they are denominated (e.g. eurodollar bond, euroyen bond)
- issued **outside the jurisdiction of any country** (do not confuse eurobond market as EU market)
- typically less regulated
- majority issued in **bearer form** - ownership is evidenced simply by possessing the bonds, good for **tax avoidance**
- allow issuers to access to a wider pool of investors

At the same time, it can also be classified depending on the market type:
- developed market
- emerging markets (riskier and higher yields)

#### Original maturity
**Original maturity** is the stated tenor of the bond at issuance.
There are three types of maturity classification:
- Money market - < 1 year
- Capital market - > 1 year but has maturity date
- Perpetuity - never ending

##### Money market
There are different types:
- T-bills - Treasury bills - original maturity of 1 year or shorter
- CP - commercial paper - unsecured, short-term deb instrument issued by corporation
- Certificate of Deposit (CD) - certificate issued to a borrower depositing money for a short specified length of time ant a specified rate of interest 

##### Capital market
There are different types of bonds in capital market:
- T-notes - treasury notes - original maturity of 1 year to 10 years
- T-bonds - treasury bonds - original maturity of >10 years
- Medium term notes (MTD) - issued by corporates - original maturity of >9 months

#### Coupon structure
There are two broad categories of coupon structure
- Fixed rate
- Floating rate - banks often make floating rate loans as a risk protection due to interest rate risk

Floating rate = Reference rate + Spread
Reference rate are normally using the 180-days London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR), which is at the rate where bank A is borrowing bank B at that specific LIBOR rate for 180 days in the money market. It is calculated from a survey from 18 banks excluding the highest and lowest, and take average.

#### Indexing
There are bonds that are linked to index:
- Inflation linked

##### Inflation linked bonds
**Treasury inflation-protected securities** also known as TIPS, is a type of capital-indexed bonds, where the principal is adjusted based on inflation, but giving out constant coupon rate. The adjusted principal repaid at maturity is based on consumer price index (CPI).

## Primary and secondary bond markets
The bond market can be separated into two types:
- Primary 
- Secondary
There are regulating authority to regulate the structure of markets and credentials of participants.

### Primary bond markets
**Primary bond market** is where issuers initially sell bonds to investors
Under the primary bond market, the issuers can issue bonds through:
- Public offering (underwritten offering, best efforts offering, shelf registration, auction)
- Private placement

### Secondary bond markets
**Secondary bond market** is where the existing bonds are traded among investors, mostly traded through over-the-counter (OTC) markets where dealers are involved or organised exchange where direct buyer/seller transaction. 

### Public offering in primary bond markets
There are 4 types of public offering:
- Underwritten offering
- Best efforts offering
- Shelf registration
- Auction

The public offering are normally organised by an investment bank.
The roles of the investment bank undergoing public offering of bonds:
1. Determine funding needs
2. Restructuring the bond
3. Creating the bond indenture
4. Naming a trustee
5. Register with regulators
6. Assess demand and determine pricing
7. Selling the bonds

#### Underwritten offering
**Underwritten offering** is when the investment bank purchases the entire bond issue. The investment bank ("underwriter") establishes the pricing, sell the bonds to dealers, which in turn sell them to the investors.

For smaller issues, 1 underwriter is possible to manage the bond distribution. However, for bigger issuers, syndicate banks with lead underwriter is involved. 

If the bonds are priced too high, the underwriters have to absorb losses from unsold bonds, and it is called **undersubscription**. if the bonds are priced too low, it is **oversubscribed**, it may mean that the issuer is not getting a fair deal. Usually, the underwriter priced to target small oversubscription, so that it reduces the risk of being unable to sell all.

##### Gauge market demand:
There are few ways to gauge market demand:
- Advertisements
- Direct marketing/road shows
- Approach large institutional investors
- Monitor the grey market

The underwriters gauge the market demand (such as pension funds and insurance companies) through advertisements, direct marketing/road shows and approach large institutional investors. The large institutional investors are also known as the anchor investors. Also, they can monitor the grey market, which is the bond forward market.

#### Best efforts offering
Best efforts offering is similar to the underwriting method, however, the investment banks do not commit to purchase the whole issue. Instead, the investment banks sell on **commission basis**, if the issuer may not raise required amount if **undersubscribed**

#### Shelf registration
**Shelf registration** is when the bond is registered with **aggregated value** through master prospectus and regulatory authority. Depending on the issuers' financial needs, the regulatory release the equivalent amount of bonds to investors. The issuers can invoke the existing master prospectus with less disclosure to get the debt funding as it is needed.

Only financially sound issuers are granted with this option.

#### Auction
Some bonds, especially government bonds are sold through **auctions**. For example, US Treasury Securities are sold through single-priced auctions. Single priced bonds are issued to all successful bidders. Most of the investors are primary dealers, which are the financial institutions authorised to deal in new issues of US Treasury.

### Private placement
**Private placement** is usually **non-underwritten**, **unregistered bonds**, the placement can be directly to the qualified investors or through investment bank. Since they are unregistered, there are no secondary market. As such, they normally come with higher yield for the lack of liquidity for investor. Most of the investors for private placements are insurance companies and pension funds as they do not require liquidity in their portfolio.

Since the issuers normally release these in small amounts, the investors can influence the structure of the bond. 

In order to protect the investors, the bond indenture will often have included collateral, credit enhancement, and covenants.

## Secondary bond market
Majority of the bonds are traded in the **secondary OTC markets** via a dealer. The dealer posts differential bid/ask price. The difference between the bid and ask price is the bid-ask spread. The **average bid-ask spread for liquid bonds is 10-12bp** but varies from the bond's liquidity. 

### Clearing system
There is a clearing system when the bond settlement is made. Settlement of **government bond is normally on the day of the trade or T+1**. **Corporate bonds normally settled on T+2 or T+3**. Although in some markets, it's longer.

## Bonds from government and government-related sectors
There are multiple types of bonds issued by the government:
- Sovereign bonds

### Sovereign bonds
Sovereign bonds are:
- issued by the national governments or their treasuries
- backed by taxing power of the government

The sovereign bonds are normally issued in __ currency:
- Local currency - receive high credit rating (as considered default free - as can be paid through tax or printing money)
- Foreign currency - as demand from overseas or the currency risk from emerging markets, therefore demand the bond to be issued in USD or EUR; normally a lower credit rating vs local currency bond; the local government must convert their own currency to service the debt obligation

The Swiss government issues US-dollar denominated bonds. Which of the following is most likely the reason for doing this?
The Swiss government has a very good credit rating, so there is good demand for its bonds in a widely-accepted currency like the US dollar.

Sovereign bonds duration for US:
- T-bills - <1 year (Money market)
- T-notes - 1-10 years (Capital market)
- T-bonds - >10 years  (Capital market)

As sovereign bonds mature, they are traded less frequently. The most recent issues are usually the most actively traded. The most recent issues are also known as **on-the-run bonds**. The  most recent issues are also known as the **benchmark bonds**. The yields of non-sovereign and corporate bonds are determined relative to the "benchmark" yield.

The T-bills are issued at **pure discount** - where the principle returned will be at the par value.
Whereas T-notes and T-bonds, the bond will be in bullet structure, where there will be regular coupons at semi-annual payment and the principle returned at the maturity date. These are both regarded as **fixed rate bonds**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 18.45.13.png]]
**Note:** US T-notes have original maturity of 1 to 10 years. Note that securities are classified as money market securities only if their original maturity is less than or equal to 1 year. It has nothing to do with the remaining term to maturity.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 18.50.37.png]]
The **fixed rate bonds** have the interest rate fixed at issuance, it provides certainty in the cash flow, however, there is a high interest rate risk. As the interest rate increases, the bond price will be lowered. The fixed rate bonds also suffer from high inflation risk as the coupons are fixed, the cash flow will be eroded after time.

There is a **floating rate bond**, such as using the **LIBOR** as the reference rate. Instead of fixed coupon, the floating rate coupon allow for lower interest rate risk, however, with less certainty on the cash flow. The US released US treasury FRN since Jan 2014.

Also, there are **inflation linked bonds**, where the coupon is indexed-linked and principle+inflation premium returned, there are less certain cash flow, however, protects again like floating rate bond, that low inflation risk. The US treasury released US TIPS at Jan 1997, and the reference rate is **CPI-Urban consumers**.

### Non-sovereign bonds
**Non-sovereign bonds** are issued by the states and provinces to fund local budget and projects. The projects will then generate revenue, at the same time there will be special project taxes and local taxes to pay back to the bond holders.

Generally the credit quality is high due to low default rate, but higher yield than sovereign bonds, higher rating if guaranteed by national government. Example: California municipal bonds

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 18.58.34.png]]

### Agency/quasi-government bonds
**Agency/quasi-government bonds** are issued by quasi-government entity whereby financing small business and providing mortgage financing. The cash payment source is normally from the cash flow from entity. The credit rating are usually high, due to low default rate, quality of collaterals can increase the credit rating, and might receive higher rating if guaranteed by national government. Example: Fannie Mae bonds (federal national mortgages associations)

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 18.58.47.png]]


### Supranational bonds
**Supranational bonds** are bonds issued by supranational agencies, since they are not government entities, they do not have tax revenue. The cash are from donations, investment income, and loan income. The supranational bonds generally have high credit quality and very liquidity as they generally have large issues. Examples: World Bank bonds, IMF bonds.

## Corporate debt
There are several ways to raise capital through debt as a company:
- Bank debt
- Commercial paper
- Corporate bonds

Normal capital structure of a company is as follows:
- Bank loans
- Publicly-issued debt
- Equity
The capital raised to fulfil short-term spending needs and long-term capital investments.
![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 19.12.04.png]]

### Bank loans
**Bank loans** are the primary source of debt financing for **SME**, also for **large companies** in countries where bond markets are **under-developed**.

When the loan is involved with 1 bank, it is a **bilateral loan**. When the loan is involved with multiple banks, it is referred to **syndicate loan**. Besides banks, insurance companies and pension funds can be part of the syndicate.

The loans are often packaged and securitised, and sold to the secondary market for investors. Most of the bank loans are floating rate, it is the reference rate + spread. The reference rate are mostly **LIBOR** or overnight rate at which banks lend to each other, **prime rate**.

Bank loans can be customised in these ways:
- Maturity
- Frequency of payment
- Repayment structure - eg. bullet loan, amortising loan (principle is repaid over loan period)

Bank loans can be more expensive option for larger creditworthy corporations.

### Commercial paper
**Commercial paper** is a short-term unsecured security, the interest cost of commercial paper is lower than bank loans. It is used to fund working capital.

The **US Commercial paper (USCP)** is issued in USD, with a maturity date < 270 days (as it is exempted from SEC registration). The interest is in a discount basis.

The **Eurocommercial paper (ECP)** can be issued in any currency, with a maturity date < 364 days. The interest is either discount or interest-bearing basis.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 19.25.47.png]]

US Commercial Paper 

holding period yield = Interest = $1M x 4% x 90/360 = $10,000
USCPs are issued on a discount basis, so:
Issued: $0.99M
Redeemed: $1M

HPY = $1M/$0.99M â€“ 1 = 1.01%


As the bond matures, the corporation will have to issue new commercial paper, as there is a re-issuance of bond to the market. The company commercial paper have a **rollover risk**, where the risk that a company will not be able to sell new commercial paper to replace maturity paper. It could be due to the **credit rating** of the company dropped, or the macroeconomic financial uncertainty.

In order to increase the credit rating, the company normally do have a backup line of credit. If needed, the bank will lend when the paper matures, except if company's financial situation has deteriorated significantly.

### Corporate bonds
The most common type of company bonds is **corporate bond**. There are several aspects of discussion:
- Maturity
- Coupon structure
- Principle repayment structure
- Collateral backing
- Contingency provisions

#### Maturity
There are several description for maturity date:
- Short (1-5 years) - notes
- Intermediate (5-12 years) - notes
- Long (>12 years) - bonds

Or in general, they are referred to **medium term notes (MTN)** ranging the maturity date from 9 months to 100 years. The issuers will contact the agent with some requirement of maturity and yield, the agent will then match the investor with a certain yield and then discuss with the issuer. 

It gives the issuer the **maximum flexibility** for issuing securities on a **continuous basis**.

With single maturity date, it is called **termed maturity structure**, if the bond is with multiple maturity dates, it is called **serial maturity structure**.

### Coupon structure

The coupon structures are as follow:
- **Fixed coupon**
- **Floating rate** - coupon adjusts to changes to a certain metric (e.g. market interest, level of interest, issuer's credit quality)
- **Payment-in-kind** - remunerated in bonds/equities
- **Deferred coupon**
- **Zero coupon** - sold at discount to par, interest implicit to discount

The **fixed coupon** structure is as follow:
- Annually
- Semi-annually - most conventional
- Quarterly

### Principle repayment structure
As the years of the bond to the maturity is longer (tenor of bonds), there is an increase in credit risk. Therefore, there will be a sinking fund provision as a measure to protect the borrower.

#### Sinking fund provisions
With the **sinking fund provision**, the borrower is required to retired a certain amount worth of bonds each year starting from a certain period of time up till maturity date. 
There are several ways to retire bonds:
- Randomly choose from outstanding bonds pool - **redeem at par**
- Buy back bonds from open market - **redeem at market price**

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 20.55.56.png]]

#### Serial bond issues
With **serial bond issues**, the bonds are issued with several maturity dates so that a portion is redeemed periodically. The ways to retire the bond is through redeem **specific** bonds at their **specific redemption date**. The bond with multiple maturity dates are known as **serial maturity structure**.

### Collateral backing
**Collateral backing** improves the credit quality, as there are assets such as equipment, financial assets, and other assets act as collateral. For **secured bonds**, at the time of company default, the company is able to finance its debt through selling assets.

**Equipment trust certificate** is backed by physical assets of value.
**Collateral trust bonds** are backed by financial assets.

Unsecured bonds do not have collaterals, the general claim on the assets and cash flows after all of the secured bonds have been served.

### Contingency provision
**Contingency provision** is the clause that allows for **some action** if a specified event or circumstance occurs. 

Issuer options - call, redeem bonds before maturity, at predetermined price, on specific dates.
Lender options - put - sell bonds back to the issuers before maturity, at predetermined price, on specific dates.
Lender options - convertible bond - 

## Structured financial instruments
The **structured financial instruments** are repackaged and redistribute risks, often times, it combines the bond with derivatives. **Derivatives** are a type of financial instrument where it derives the value from underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. The risk and returns of the structured financial instrument is linked to the derivative.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.05.29.png]]

There are 4 types of structured financial instruments:
- **Capital protected** - guarantee of a minimum value at maturity + potential upside
- **Yield enhancement** -  increases the risk exposure and expecting a higher expected return
- **Participation** - allow investors to participate in return of an underlying asset
- **Leveraged** - magnify the return of an underlying asset and have possible high payoff from small investments

### Capital protected instruments
**Capital protected instruments** guarantee of a minimum value at maturity + potential upside. 

E.g. This security will return 100% of capital, plus any gains on apple's stock over the next year.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 21.42.08.png]]

#### How to achieve this?
$$\mathrm{Capital\,protected\,instrument = Zero\,coupon\,bond + Call\,option}$$
- Use that 50USD discounted price to buy the zero-coupon bond + call option with the expiry date at the same time of maturity date. 
- If the apple stock price performs poorly than the strike price, the option is voided.
- If the apple stock price performs better than the strike price,
![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 21.42.53.png]]
It is called **guaranteed certificate**.

### Yield enhancement instrument
**Yield enhancement instrument** increases the risk exposure and expecting a higher expected return.

$$\mathrm{Credit\,linked\,note (CLN) = Note - Credit\,default\,swap \,(CDS)}$$

**Credit default swap** is an insurance contract against the default of the underlying asset, and it is sold by credit protection seller. CDS buyers pays regular premiums to the credit protection seller. The CDS premiums+regular coupons can have a higher yield of the bond.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 21.52.38.png]]
At the time of credit event did not occur, the CDS expires and the CLN can be return of the par value.
However, at the time where credit event did occur, i.e. the company default on the payment, the credit protection seller has to return the money to CDS buyer and the CDS return of less than par value. At this time, the CLN fails to have a higher yield.

### Participation instruments
**Participation instruments** allow investors to participate in return of an underlying asset.

Eg.
$$\mathrm{Floating\,rate\,note= Note - Interst\,Rate\,Forwards}$$
$$\mathrm{Coupon\,rate= Spread + \triangle90\,day\,LIBOR}$$
![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 21.58.14.png]]

Eg.2
$$\mathrm{Floating\,rate\,note= Note + S\&P500\,futures}$$
![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.00.37.png]]

### Leveraged instruments
**Leveraged instrument** magnify the return of an underlying asset and have possible high payoff from small investments.

The **leveraged instrument** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Leveraged\,instrument= Note + Leverage\,factor\times \triangle Reference}$$


eg. **Inverse floater** - The coupon payout **inverse relationship to reference rate**
$$\mathrm{Inverse\,floater= Note + Leverage\,factor\times Interst\,Rate\,Forwards}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.02.34.png]]

If the **leverage factor is < 1**, the coupon payout is less sensitive to reference rate, and it is **deleveraged**. A deleveraged inverse floater has a coupon that increases or decreases by less than the change in its reference rate.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.03.52.png]]

If the **leverage factor is > 1,** the coupon payout is less sensitive to reference rate, and it is **leveraged**. A leveraged inverse floater has a coupon that increases or decreases by more than the change in its reference rate. 

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.04.38.png]]

## Short-term fundings for banks
Banks enjoy a different set of fundings, especially short-term fundings for banks, they are as follow:
- Retail deposits
- Certificates of deposits (CD)
- Reserve funds
- Interbank funds
- Repurchase agreements (Repos)

### Retail deposits
The banks hold deposits from individuals and companies. All these are known as **retail deposits**. 
There are several types of retail deposits:
- checking accounts - allow for immediate transaction without interest
- money market accounts - allow for some period of notice for transaction and with interest
- savings accounts - longer period of notice for transaction and with interest

### Certificate of deposit (CD)
**Certificate of deposit (CD)** is a certificate where it has an interest rate and shorter period of maturity in the wholesale market. CDs are mostly < 1 years and paid at maturity. CDs with longer maturities are called "term CDs". Denomination of >1M USD are important funding sources for banks.

There are two forms: non-negotiable or negotiable.
![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.18.27.png]]

### Reserve funds
The reason behind **reserve fund** is because of the regulation of central bank, where a bank must have a certain amount of **reserve balance** with the central bank. The reserve balance provide liquidity if the customers would like to withdraw funds.

If the reserve balance goes below the minimum required level, there are two options:
- the bank is allowed to borrow from central bank's reserve fund
- borrow from reserve balance of other banks

For some banks they have reserve balance over the minimum level, the bank can then borrow from those banks to reach the min level.

The borrowed funds are called **central bank funds**.
'Overnight funds' are for 1 day.
'Term funds' - are funds that borrowed from 2 days to 1 year.

The **central bank fund rates** are market determined, but strongly influenced by central bank's open market operations. The US central bank fund rates are called **fed funds rates**. This **Fed funds rates** influence a lot of the short-term debt securities.

### Interbank funds
**Interbank funds** are funds that **directly lend from one bank to another**. The borrowing duration can be from 1 day to 1 year **(short-term)**. These types of loans are **unsecured**, liquidity might hampered severely during the time of systemic financial distress. It can't be used for topping up reserved balance of other banks.

### Repurchase agreements (Repos)
**Repurchase agreements (Repos)** are not just only for banks but for other market participants. The borrower borrows by selling collateral security and promises to buy it back and paying interest. **Reverse repurchase agreement** is on the standpoint of lender, where lend by buying collateral security, sells it back, and earning interest.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-23 at 22.27.35.png]]

$$\mathrm{Repo\,rate=(\frac{Repurchase\,price}{Selling\,price}-1)}$$
The repo rate is usually cheaper than bank loans or other ST borrowings.

A borrower posted a a $1 million collateral for a $950,000 repo. The collateral will be repurchased in 180 days for $970,000. What is the repo rate for this arrangement?
Repo rate is annualised.
Repo rate = (970000/950000)^2 â€“ 1 = 4.25%

#### Factors that affect the repo rate
- â†‘ Term, â†‘ Repo rate
- â†‘Credit quality, â†“ Repo rate
- Delivered to lender, â†“ Repo rate
- â†‘Interest rate of alternatives, â†‘ Repo rate

### Credit default
If credit issue occurs, i.e. the borrower does not buy back the collateral at repurchase date, the lender can execute by selling the collateral.

Repo margin provides the margin of safety if the collateral's market value declines.

#### Factors that affect the repo margin
- â†‘ Term, â†‘ Repo margin
- â†‘ Credit quality of the collateral, â†“ Repo margin
- â†“ Supply, â†“ Repo margin
- â†‘ Credit quality of the borrower, â†“ Repo margin
