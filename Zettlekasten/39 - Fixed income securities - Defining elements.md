## Overview of fixed income
**Fixed income security** is a bond that allows borrower to borrow money from the lender. The most common type of fixed income security is a bond. A bond is a contractural agreement between the bond issuer and the bond holders. The bond issuer are the borrowers, and the lenders are the bond holders.

### Points of consideration
There are few points of consideration before investing in bonds:
- Bond features (going to expand on later session)
- Legal, regulatory, tax considerations
- Contingency provisions - may affect the bond scheduled cash flow, may give certain rights to bondholders or bond issuers certain disposal and redemption of the bond 

## Bond features
There are several types of bond features that the bondholder has to be aware of:
- Issuer
- Maturity date
- Face/par value
- Coupon rate/frequency
- Currency
These are the features that determine the cash flow, therefore these are the key determinants of whether invest in this bond.

### Issuers
There are mainly 3 types of issuers:
- Government sector - supranational (e.g. World bank, IMF), sovereign national governments (e.g. US, Singapore), non-sovereign (local) governments (e.g. California, Toronto), related government entities/Quasi-government (e.g. Fannie Mae, government agencies)
- Corporate sector - Financial (banks, insurance companies), non-financial companies
- Structured finance sector - special legal entities (e.g. create asset-backed securities)

### Maturity date
**Maturity date** is the date set on the bond contract of when should the principal to be repaid. The time to maturity is also known as **term to maturity/tenor**.
There are bonds maturity at 1 day up to 30 years or even more. The bond's maturity less than 1 year is also known as **money market securities**, and the bond's maturity date more than 1 year is known as **capital market securities**. There are some bonds without maturity date, they are known as perpetual bonds, and these types of bonds do not promise to pay the full borrowed amount at a specific date.

### Face/par value
**Face/par value** of bond is the principal amount that will be repaid at maturity. Thera re also other names to the **face value**, including **maturity value**, **redemption value**, and **principal value**. The bond value is always represented as a percentage/value in comparison to the face value. If the face value > current price, it is **premium to par**. If the current price < face value, this is **discount to par**. If the bond value is exactly the same as face value, then it is trading at par.

### Coupon rate/ frequency
The coupon rate is the % that the bond is promised to make at a certain frequency up until the point of maturity date. If x% of coupon is promised as annual payments, then the x% amount will be paid at the end of the end. If x% of coupon is promised to be paid as semi-annual payments, then x/2 are being paid semi-annually. If x% of coupon is promised to be paid as quarterly payments, then x/4 are being paid quarterly, or even monthly payments, with the same logic of x/12. The most common type is **semi-annual** payments.

### Currency
A bond has to determine what the currency to be paid back to the lenders, for both the interest and principal.
**USD denominated bond** - Countries which have fluctuating currency rates, they are more likely to give out USD denominated bond - as it means less risk to the lenders. Both the interest and principal will be paid out in USD.
**Dual-currency bond** - where interest payments are in currency A, and principal payment in currency B.
**Currency option** - allows the bondholder to pick the payment currency.

### Calculations of bond yield
Price of the bond may fluctuate due to secondary market trading activity. At issuance, the yield is equal to the coupon rate. However, when the price deviates from the par value, the yield changes.

There are several ways to calculate a bond yield:
- Current yield
- Yield-to-maturity

**Current yield** - Understand the yield of coupon in relative to the bond price.
$$\mathrm{Current\,yield=\frac{Annual\,coupon}{Bond\,price}}$$
However, it does not consider that the bond price will be at par value at the time of maturity date.

**Yield-to-maturity** - is an estimate of what the investor annual rate of return by calculating in the factor of today's price and hold till maturity. It is the internal rate of return (IRR) on expected cash flow. The CF calculation is detailed in the quantitative calculation. Yield-to-maturity has an inverse relationship to price. As the price of a bond goes up, the yield-to-maturity goes down.

In this situation, there are several numbers that have to be inputted in the calculator.
PV: -1030; PMT (Coupon): 40; N(number of times of coupons being paid): 2; FV:1000; **CPT I/Y: 2.44%**; however, this is a semi-annual yield, and the annual yield is $2.44\% \times 2= 4.88\%$

## Bond types - Coupon structures
There are several types of coupon structures:
- Plain vanilla
- Amortising
- Sinking fund provisions
- Floating-rate
- Index-linked
- Step-up coupon
- Deferred coupon

### Plain vanilla bond
**Plain vanilla bond** - it is the most prevalent form of a bond.
Coupons are paid regularly and It is also known as to have the **bullet** structure with fixed coupon payouts. The full par value is paid at maturity. The final payment is principal + final coupon. This final payment is also known as the **balloon payment**. Under this scheme, the full principal amount is repaid on maturity date. The huge balloon payment exposes the bondholder at a higher credit risk. **Credit risk** occurs when the borrower is unable to fulfil debt obligations.

### Amortising bond
**Amortising bond** - where the interest and principal payments are paid at the same time. With the interest payment at large and smaller principal payments in the beginning, and larger principal payments with smaller interest payments in later date till maturity date. The well-known one is mortgage payment on property.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 20.39.51.png]]
**Amortising bond** can be **fully amortising** and **partially amortising**. 
**Fully amortising bond** - make the bond payment (principal + interest) without a balloon payment
**Partially amortising bond** - make the bond payment (principal + interest) with a balloon payment

### Sinking fund provisions
With the sinking fund provision, the borrower is required to retired a certain amount worth of bonds each year starting from a certain period of time up till maturity date. 
There are several ways to retire bonds:
- Randomly choose from outstanding bonds pool - redeem at par
- Buy back bonds from open market - redeem at market price

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 20.55.56.png]]

If the bond price is below par, the borrower is more likely to redeem the bond at market price.
If the bond price is above par, the borrower is likely to redeem at par; however, the bondholders might not be happy as the price at par is lower than the current bond price.

### Floating-rate
**Floating rate bonds** have variable coupon payments, it follows suits of reference rate (e.g. 6-months LIBOR) + margin (to compensate the lender's credit risk). For FRNs, the **reference interest rate to apply is the rate 1 period before the coupon payment** (i.e. coupon rate of a floating-rate note that makes payments every year in March and September is the 180-day LIBOR + 30 bps: The 180-day LIBOR in March this year was 1.5%, and 2.0% in September. Â What is the interest rate that applies for the September coupon? 1.8%).

There is also a cap, if the reference rate + margin > cap; then the cap coupon rate/amount is being paid out. At the same time, there is a floor, to protect the bondholders to have a certain amount of coupon being paid out despite the lowering of reference rate.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 21.00.12.png]]

**Inverse floater** has the negative correlation with the reference rate.

### Index-linked
The **index-linked bonds** have their coupon payouts linked to performance of named index. The index can be commodity index, equity index, inflation index etc.
Index-linked bonds:
- Inflation-linked bonds
- Interest-annuity bonds
- Indexed zero-coupon bonds
- Capital-indexed bonds (e.g. Treasury Inflation Protected Security, TIPS)
- Credit linked bonds

**Interest-indexed bonds** - interest adjusted for inflation
**Interest-annuity bonds** - fully amortising bonds with periodic payments adjusted for inflation
**Indexed zero-coupon bonds** - sold at a discount at initiation, and the payment at maturity adjusted for inflation.
**Capital-indexed bonds** - principal adjusted based on inflation; constant coupon rate but adjusted with the principal, so it's fluctuating in amount. Again, the adjusted principal is repaid at maturity. (however, US TIPS are capital-indexed bonds where only the principal is adjusted for inflation.)
**Credit-linked bonds** - the coupon rate is inversely correlated with credit rating, it protects the bondholders, but increase the probability of default

### Step-up coupon
A **step-up coupon** has a schedule for incremental increase of coupon rate after a certain period of time. There is a base rate of the coupon, with a step-up schedule and increase in coupon rate at certain time.
Step-up coupon normally has the option of redeeming the bond at times to step-up the coupon rate. This can protect the bondholders against rising interest rates.
For example, if the market interest rate is higher than the preset constant coupon rate, with step-up bond, the issuer is likely to call back bonds as stepped up interest of a promised percentage might be higher.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 21.47.13.png]]

### Deferred coupon
**Deferred coupon** structure is also known as a split. The debtor would only make scheduled regular payments after a certain period of time. The full balloon payment is paid at last a the maturity date. Deferred coupon is offered by firms that anticipated insufficient cash flow to make up for the payments at the beginning of bond issuance. (e.g. constructions, normally pay back to bondholders upon completion of the project)

![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 21.51.28.png]]

Two special types of the deferred coupon bond are **zero coupon bond** and **payment-in-kind bond**.

#### Zero coupon bond
**Zero coupon bond** do not pay out coupons like other normal bonds do, instead, it has a discounted bond value compared to the par value. Then, the bond yield is calculated to understand what is the internal rate of return annually. Again, use the TVM calculator to calculate the IRR.

#### Payment-in-kind bond
**Payment-in-kind bond** is issued at par, and it does not payout regular coupon payments. Instead, the principal is increased and repaid at maturity. It is offered by firms who believes that it is unable to meet regular bond payments. These types of bonds are normally offered at higher yield, as they are perceived as bonds with higher credit and maturity risks.

### Credit risks and maturity risks with bonds
Plain vanilla bonds are bonds with credit risks and maturity risks. As the debtors have only been making coupon payments until the balloon payment of par value arrives at the end of the bond (maturity date). It has inherent credit risks with plain vanilla bonds.

At the same time, with longer the tenor date of the bond, the higher the credit risk alongside with maturity risks.

## Legal and regulatory aspect of the bond - Bond indenture
**Trust deed** is the legal contract that describes the structure of the bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders. The **bond indenture** describes the bond features. The indenture is normally held by the **trustee**.

### Trustee
The **trustee** is normally appointed by the issuer to be the middle person, normally the financial institute to mediate the bond indenture.

The trustee has to do the following:
- ensure that issuers complies with obligations
- take actions on behalf of the bond holders
- ensure timely payments
- calling meetings of bondholders
- bring legal actions against the issuer, if necessary

### Bond indentures
The **bond indenture** may also include the:
- issuer
- funding sources
- collateral
- credit enhancement
- covenants

#### Issuer
There are 3 main sectors of a bond issuer:
- **Government sector** - sovereign bonds, often issued by treasury of issuing country
- **Corporate sector** - it can be issued by **holding company,** **company**, or **subsidiary**; credit quality can differ among all of these entities, if the subsidiary default, the parent company might not give out the payment unless secured on the bond indenture, same goes to holding company, it does not give the right to claim the subsidiary companies. They should be viewed as different entities unless stated in the bond indenture.
- **Structured finance sector** - **securitised bonds**, creating a separate legal entity for owning specific assets and issuing bonds, these are also referred to **special purpose vehicle**, as this is bankruptcy remote, since the bondholders cannot make claims on the company itself. A special purpose vehicle is a separate entity from the originating company. As such, the ABS bondholders cannot hold the originating company to fulfil the debt obligations. Also, it can allow the lender to be lending the money at a lower interest rate as there're asset backed securities. 
![[Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 22.14.54.png]]

#### Funding sources
**Government sector** - sovereign bonds, the bond repayments are generally by the government raise taxes and to print money. 
**Corporate sector** - corporate bonds, the bond repayments are generally from the operations, it is being determined by the cash flow of the company (profitability of the company) and generally it is more risky, so again, it is compensated by higher coupon rate.
**Structured finance sector** - securitised bond, the coupons are solely paid out by the cash flow generated from the asset. Therefore, the quality of the underlying assets from the special purpose vehicle is very important.

### Collateral
A company's **collateral** is underlying the debt obligations, above and beyond the interests are paid. 

**Secured bonds** - backed by assets or financial guarantees **pledged** to ensure debt repayment in the case of default. The **pledged assets** are known as **collaterals**. 

Regarding to the different assets that the company holds, there are different type of bonds:
- **Equipment trust certificates** - backed by physical assets of value
- **Collateral trust bonds** - backed by financial assets

**Unsecured bonds** - There are no collateral, therefore it can only make general claim on assets and cash flows. Other assets (PP&E)

Under the event of liquidation (i.e. when the company goes bankrupt), the secured bondholders are going to get the value of collaterals. Then, the remaining value will have a waterfall scheme, which will first flow to the senior unsecured bond, then to the junior unsecured bond.

### Debenture
**Debenture** have different meanings depending on the geographical location. **Debenture** refers to **secured bonds** in the **UK** and it refers to **unsecured bonds** in the **US**.

### Credit enhancement
**Credit enhancement** are provisions that can be used to reduce the credit risk of a bond issue. It is normally created under the scheme of asset-backed security (ABS). There are two ways to enhance credit: **internal enhancement** and **external enhancement**.

There are three main types of **internal enhancements**:
- **Subordination** - credit tranching, by creating different seniority of the bond, to fulfil the highest seniority first, then others (i.e. waterfall structure).
- **Overcollateralisation** - collateral pledged > par value
- **Reserve accounts** - cash reserve funds (i.e. cash reserved to top up the obligation payments) or excess spread account (i.e. expected yield > obligation; it can be used to retire some of the bonds at later period of time)

There are three main types of **external enhancements**:
- **Surety bonds** - issued by insurance company to top up the shortfall amount
- **Bank guarantees** - issued by bank to top up the shortfall amount
- **Letter of credit** - promises to lend issuer the shortfall amount of cash flow that is obligated to pay to the bondholders

![[Screenshot 2023-02-17 at 20.20.36.png]]
With the increase in credit quality, the yield will decrease.

#### Covered bonds
**Covered bonds** are bonds offered by financial institutions act similarly to the asset-backed security (ABS), but since it's in the covered pool, **the asset remains in the balance sheet**. It shares the same characteristic of the SPV, where provides the firm from bankruptcy remote. For the covered pool, **the firm has to replace the asset, if the asset can no longer make up for the coupon payments/debt payments**. It is considered as credit enhancement and it lowers the yield of the bond.

### Covenants
**Debt covenants** are legally enforceable rules that the borrowers and lenders agree on when a bond is issued. There are forms of **affirmative covenants** and **negative covenants**. Covenants protect bondholders against issuer actions that can disadvantage the bondholders. As such, this reduces the risk and therefore the yield of the bonds can be lower.

#### Affirmative covenants
- Make timely payments of principal and interest
- Maintain certain ratios, such as current, debt-to-equity, and interest coverage ratios.
- Maintain collateral, if any, in working order.

#### Negative covenants
- Increasing dividends or repurchasing shares.
- Issuing more debt/senior debt.
- Engaging in M&A
- Making speculative investments
- Restrictions on asset disposals

If any of the covenants were breached, it is considered as technical default, the lenders/bondholders can demand for immediate repayment.

## Legal and regulatory aspect of the bond - Cross-border insurance


|Type | Currency | Market |
|----|----|----|
|Domestic|Local | Local|
|Foreign|Foreign | Foreign|
|US - "Yankee"|Local | Foreign (AUS trading USD in US market)|
|AU - "Kangaroo"|Local | Foreign (US trading AUD in AUS market)|
|Eurobond|Local/Foreign |Eurobond|

The domestic and foreign bonds are registered bond, where the ownership is recorded.

**Eurobond**:
- named after the currency in which they are denominated (e.g. eurodollar bond, euroyen bond)
- issued outside the jurisdiction of any country (do not confuse eurobond market as EU market)
- typically less regulated
- majority issued in **bearer form** - ownership is evidenced simply by possessing the bonds, good for tax avoidance

## Tax considerations of bonds
There are tax considerations depending on whether the bond is sold prior to maturity, along with that there're different types of taxes depending on the bond structure.

There are several types of coupon structures:
- Plain vanilla
- Amortising
- Sinking fund provisions
- Floating-rate
- Index-linked
- Step-up coupon
- Deferred coupon

#### Plain vanilla bond tax structure
- Coupon interest income is taxed as ordinary income
- Selling prior to the maturity date is taxed as capital gains income, usually lower rate than ordinary income

#### Zero coupon bond
- It is treated as original issue discount (OID) bonds
- The value between the discounted price to par value is then treated as interest income and taxed as ordinary income

## Contingency provisions
**Contingency provision** is a clause that allows for some action if a specified event or circumstance occurs. They are treated as **embedded options** as it is an integral part of the contract and it cannot be traded separately. At the same time, they are **options** as bondholders/issuers have the right, but not the obligation, to take the action. 

The bonds without options are known as **straight bonds**. The options of issuers are **call**, and the lenders/bondholders equivalents are **put** and **convertible**.

### Callable bonds
**Callable bonds** give the issuer the **right to redeem** all or part of the bond before the specified maturity date.

Companies may want to do that to benefit from lower interest rates in the future.
Companies normally set their coupon rate at the market interest rate + risk premium (aka. spread) depending on the credit quality of the company. However, in a lower interest rate environment, now the company can borrow at a lower interest. The issuer may exercise the **callable bond** to pay the bondholders, and reissue another bond for lower interest rate.

Callable bonds gives the issuer the option to recall the bonds at specified dates before maturity. Therefore, if interest rates fall, the issuer can choose to call back the bonds and issue new bonds at lower rates.

For the investor/bondholder, the money can only be reinvested for a lower yield. There is a **reinvestment risk** for bondholders. Therefore, generally, the non-callable bond **have lower yield/reinvestment risk** than the callable bonds. The higher yield compensates the bondholders to have higher reinvestment risk.

The **callable bonds** normally has a **call protection period**, where the issuer is prohibited from calling. It is the period that the bond issuer assures to give out coupon at the rate until the bond can be callable. The date when the call protection period ends is the call date. There might be multiple call dates.

**Call price** is normally not just the face value of the bond, normally it is with the premium. The **call schedule** specifies the date and price when and the value of the bond is being called.

#### Call schedule styles
There are multiple styles to be called:
- European style - only on specified call date
- American style - any time after call date
- Bermuda style - specified dates after first call date

### Make whole call provision
**Make-whole call provision** allows the issuer to maintain a **callable but similar interest rate to non-callable** by achieving lowered reinvestment risk.

When the bond is called on the call date, the call price is not just the face value, however, it will be the **PV of the future cash flow**. 

![[Screenshot 2023-02-17 at 21.09.35.png]]

The **calculated call price** is unlikely going to be lower than the **market value** of the bond. The issuers do not benefit from lower interest rates, the issuers are less likely to call unless necessary. Unless in certain circumstances such as M&A or restructuring.

### Putable bonds
**Putable bonds** means that the bondholder has the **right to sell** the bond back to the issuer at a pre-determined price on specified dates. **Putable bonds** are beneficial to the bondholders when the interest rates of the market has increased and over the promised yield of the original bond. At the time, normally the bond is traded lower than par value as the **market price decreases** as the **interest rate increases.** The **putable option** guarantees the bondholder can sell at face value at the **put date**. 

The redemption of the bond allow the bondholders to reinvest for a higher yield in line with the higher market interest rate.

#### Put schedule styles
There are multiple styles to be put:
- European style - only on specified put date
- American style - any time after put date
- Bermuda style - specified dates after first put date

The putable bond has lower yield as it guarantee the bondholder has a specified price on put dates. 

### Convertible bonds
**Convertible bonds** give the bondholders **right to exchange** the bond for a specific number of shares of the issuer's **common stock**

**Bonds** are generally considered safer than stocks, as it generate steady cashflow at the same time of returning principal repayment. The **market price** of the bonds fluctuate with the change in market interest rate and quality of the bond, but generally it is close to the face value. Also, it is more senior in claims in asset quality. **Bonds offer limited upside, but with downside protection.**

**Stocks** return depends on the company performance, outlook and cashflow. the dividends can be uncertain and irregular. The share price can potentially appreciate a lot due to the company's performance. **Stocks offer unlimited upside, but no downside protection.** 

**Convertible bonds** allow the bondholders to have unlimited upside, at the same time of downside protection. If the stock performs poorly, then the bondholder can treat is as a **straight bond**. If the stock performs well, then the bondholder can **convert** into common stock and the investor will become a shareholder.

Normally, convertible bonds are with lower yield, it benefits both parties as the **bondholder** can have **unlimited upside while having downside protection**, the **issuer** has **lower interest expense and elimination of debt**. **Existing shareholders** may not be happy as it is considered dilutive to the existing shares.

#### Conversion terms
There are several terms for conversions:
- Conversion price
- Conversion ratio
- Conversion value
- Conversion premium
- Conversion parity

**Conversion price** is the price per share which the bond may be converted to common stock, it is determined at issuance of the bond.

**Conversion ratio** is the number of shares received for each converted bond, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Conversion\,ratio=\frac{Par\,value\,of\,bond}{Conversion\,price}}$$

**Conversion value** is the market value of the shares that would be received upon conversion, and the equation is as follows: 
$$\mathrm{Conversion\,value=Price\,per\,share\times Conversion\,ratio}$$

**Conversion premium** is the conversion value - bond price at conversion
$$\mathrm{Conversion\,premium = Conversion\,value - Bond\,price\,at \,conversion}$$

Conversion ratio = 1000/50 = 20 (i.e. 20 shares received for every converted bond)
Conversion value = 70Ã—20 = $1400 (market value of shares received)
Conversion premium = $1400-$1060 = $340

**Conversion parity** is when the conversion value = convertible bond price. 
It will make no difference in net worth for the bondholders to convert the bond to stock.

## Special types of bonds
There are special types of bonds:
- **Convertible bonds** can be embedded with call provisions
- Contingent convertible bonds "CoCos"
- Straight bonds with warrants

### Contingent convertible bonds "CoCos"
**Contingent convertible bonds "CoCos"** are bonds that will automatically convert from bonds to stocks if a specific event occurs. Normally these are issued by European banks, as there is a minimum requirement for how much the bank should be financed by equity (Equity financing). It automatically convert the bonds to stocks to decrease the liabilities and increase equities. 

Since this event is automatically triggered, therefore the bond issuers have to give bondholders higher coupon rate to compensate this.

### Straight bonds with warrants
**Straight bonds with warrants** is when the bondholder can hold the bonds while having the right to exercise warrants. **Warrants** give the bondholders **right to buy** shares at a **given price** over a **given period of time**. This strategy allows the bondholders to have the straight bond at the same time of having common stocks at a given price.

It has benefits for both parties, where the bondholder can hold onto the bonds after exercising the warrant and have common stocks. At the same time, the borrower/issuer can have extra capital as the capital is now being financed from both equity and debt.
