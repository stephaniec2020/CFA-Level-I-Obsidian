## Standard setting bodies
- Footnotes and management discussion and analysis (accruals, adjustments, management assumptions) are subject to the discretion of the management
 - The standard setting bodies provide comparability and consistency between firms
 - The standard setting bodies are professional, non-profit organisation to establish financial reporting standards
 - Internal accounting standard board (IASB) - adopted by many countries, its objective is as follows:
	 - "to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential **investors**, **lenders**, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity"
	 - also provide the information to employees and customers etc.
- IASB establishes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) - complied by international companies outside of US.
- In US, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) - US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
- Although it issue financial reporting standards, but do not enforce compliance with them


### Desirable attributes of standard-setting bodies
- Observe high professional standards (Ethics and Confidentiality)
- Have adequate authority, resources, and competencies to fulfil its responsibilities
- Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes
- Guided by a well-articulated framework
- Operate independently while seeking input from stakeholders
- Should not be influenced by special interests
- Decisions are made in the public interest

## Regulatory Authorities
- International Organisation of securities Commissions (OICU-IOSCO) is a body of regulators, but it has members of the regulatory authorities, the members consist of:
	- US Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC)
	- European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA) 
	- As for the UK, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
	- many regulatory authorities worldwide

- IOSCO's goal:
	- Uniform financial regulations across countries
- IOSCO's objective:
	- Protect investors
	- Ensure the fairness, efficiency, and transparency of markets
	- Reduce systematic risk

## US SEC and its forms
- Requires listed companies to file standardised forms regularly
- Forms:
	- S-1 - Registration statement filed prior to the sale of new securities to the public
	- 10-K - Required annual filing similar to that which a firm typically provides in its annual report to shareholders (40-F for Canadian, 20-F for others)
	- 10-Q - US firms are required to file quarterly, with updated financial statements (6-K non US firms, semi-annual filing)
	- DEF-14A - Filed when a company prepares a proxy statement for its shareholders prior to the annual meeting or other shareholder vote
	- 8-K - Filed to disclose material events like significant asset acquisition or disposal, changes in management etc.
	- 144 - Notification to the SEC when a company issues securities to certain qualified buyers
	- 3,4,5 - Beneficial ownership of securities by a company's officers and directors

## IFRS framework
- IASB - "Conceptual Framework (2010) for Financial Reporting", to assist:
	- **Standard setters** in developing and reviewing standards
	- **Prepares of financial statements** in applying standards and in dealing with issues when not specifically covered by standards
	- **Auditors** in forming an opinion on financial statements
	- **Users** in interpreting financial statement information

### Objective
- Provide financial information that is useful in making decisions about providing resources to an entity
- The information includes:
	- Financial position
	- Financial performance
	- Cash Flows

### What makes the information useful?
- **Relevance** - have predictive and/or confirmatory value (qualitative)
- **Faithful representation** - complete, neutral, and free from error (qualitative)
- **Enhancing characteristics** - including comparability, verifiability, timeliness, understandability
	- **Comparability** - financial statement presentation is consistent among firms and across time periods
	- **Verifiability**- independent observers will arrive at similar conclusions if they use the same methods
	- **Timeliness** - information is available to decision makers before it becomes stale (both enhances relevance and faithful representations)
	- **Understandability** - users should be able to readily understand the information the statements present

### What to report?
- An item should be recognised in the balance sheet or income statement if a future economic benefit from the item is probable and the item's value or cost can be measured reliably 
- Measuring financial position:
	- **Assets** - expected to provide future economic benefits
	- **Liabilities** - expected to require an outflow of economic resources
	- **Owners' Equity** - residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities
- Measuring performance:
	- **Income** - increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing liabilities, including revenues and gains
	- **Expenses** - decrease in economic benefits, either decreasing assets or increasing liabilities including losses
- **Measurement bases** include historical cost, amortised cost, current cost, realisable value, present value and fair value

### Assumptions
- **Accrual accounting** - financial statements should reflect transactions at the time they actually occur (when goods or services are delivered), the revenue is recorded when the firm earns it regardless of whether cash is paid (Buy-Now-Pay-Later) scheme can actually increase Owner's equity
- **Going concern** - Assumes the company will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, otherwise adjust to report fairly (e.g. value assets at liquidation value)

### Constraints
- **Cost** - benefit derived from the information should exceed the costs; balance between cost and benefits
- **Non-quantifiable information** - reputation, brand loyalty, innovation cannot be captured directly in financial statements

## International Accounting Standard (IAS) No. 1
### Required financial statements
- Balance sheet
- Income statement (other comprehensive income)
- Statement of changes in equity
- Statement of cash flows
- Notes, summarising accounting policies and disclosing other items

### General features for preparing financial statements
- **Fair presentation** - defined as faithfully representing the effects of the entity's transactions and events according to the standards for recognising assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
- **Going concern** - financial statements are based on the assumption that the firm will continue to exist unless its management intends to (or must) liquidate it.
- **Accrual basis** - accounting is used to prepare the financial statements other than the statement of cash flows
- **Materiality and aggregation** - meaning the financial statements should be free of misstaments or omissions that could influence the decisions of users of financial statement; similar items and separation of dissimilar items
- **No offsetting** - assets against liabilities or income against expenses unless a specific standard permits or requires it
- **Frequency of reporting** - must be at least annually
- **Comparative information** - for prior periods should be included unless a specific standard states otherwise.
- **Consistency of presentation** - between periods in how items are presented and classified with prior-period amounts disclosed for comparison

### Structure and content
- **Classified balance sheet** - show current and non-current asset and liabilities
- **Minimum specified information on face** - Balance sheet: cash equivalents, plant, property, equipment, and inventories; Other comprehensive income sheet: revenue, profit, tax expense, financial cost
- **Minimum specified note disclosures**
- **Comparative information** - for prior periods should be included unless a specific standard states otherwise.

## Convergence, comparison and evolution of standards
The IASB and FASB, along with other standard bodies, are working to achieve convergence of financial reporting standards.

Many aspects of IFRS and US GAAP have converged over the past decade.

The SEC no longer requires IFRS reporting firms to reconcile their financial statements to US GAAP.

### Major differences in IASB vs. FASB
**IASB**:
- Only **revenue** and **expenses** listed as elements related to performance
- Asset: a **resource** from which a future economic benefit is expected to flow
- Allows upward valuation of assets 

**FASB**:
- performance elements include revenue expenses, as well as **gains**, **losses**, and **comprehensive income**
- Asset: a **future economic benefit (probable)**
- **Does not allow** upward valuation

### Reasons of barriers in converging financial reporting standards
Barriers to the convergence goal in setting financial reporting standards: 
- different standard setting bodies disagree on the best treatment of certain items or issues
- certain business groups with disproportionate influence may also place pressures to block any changes in accounting practices that may not be in their best interest

However, company will normally present a reconciliation statement showing what its financial results would've been under an alternative reporting system.

### Evolution of Standards
As financial reporting standards continue to evolve, analysts need to monitor how these developments will affect the financial statements they use.

The analyst can use the financial reporting framework as a guide for evaluating what effect new products or transactions might have on financial statements.

To keep up to date on the evolving standards, an analyst can:
- monitor professional journals and the IASB and FASB websites.
- The CFA Institute produces position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Institute Center for Financial Marketing Integrity.

### Evaluation of footnotes and MD&A
Analysts must monitor:
- **footnotes** - company disclosures for significant accounting standards and estimates 
- **MD&A** - significant policies and estimates that require management judgment, impact of implementing recently issued accounting standards, should discuss if the new standards apply, the material effects on the financial statements or state that they are still evaluating the effects of the new standards.

An analyst should use these disclosures to evaluate:
- if the policies discussed cover all the relevant data in the financial statements, which policies require management to make estimates and whether the disclosures and estimates have changed since the prior period.
