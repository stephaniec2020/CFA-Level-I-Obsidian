## Income tax
**Income tax reporting** are different from financial accounting. The **financial accounting** are based on **accounting standards**, whereas **tax reporting** are based on **tax rules**.

Since there are differences in the rules in tax authorities in realising the **revenue** and **costs**,  and the sources of differences can be permanent or temporary. 

The **balance sheet** has to reconcile the **tax expense** which is reported on **financial accounting** and **tax payable** on **tax reporting** (which tax payable is derived from taxable income).

## Tax reporting
**Tax reporting** is different from financial accounting since there are sources of differences in recognising **revenue** and **costs**. **Deferred tax** is created if the recognition is temporary.

Under IFRS, a tax rate that has been enacted or substantively enacted (law in place; i.e. virtually certain to be enacted) is used to measure deferred tax items. Under U.S. GAAP, only a tax rate that has actually been enacted can be used.

The **balance sheet** reconcile the two different values through:
- **deferred tax asset (DTA)** - taxable income > pretax income (must recognise **valuations allowance** if more likely than not that DTA will not be realised); excess tax paid might be of future benefits
- **deferred tax liability (DTL)** - taxable income < pretax income (**treat DTL as equity if not expected to reverse**); less tax paid in this accounting period may have to be paid in the future

Permanent differences do not result in deferred tax items; instead they cause the **effective tax** rate to differ from the statutory tax rate. The permanent differences are never deferred but are considered increases or decreases in the effective tax rate. The financial statements include an effective tax rate reconciliation that addresses permanent differences between pretax and taxable income. If the only difference between the taxable and pretax incomes were a permanent difference, then tax expense would simply be taxes payable.

### Deferred tax liability (DTL)
**Deferred tax liability (DTL)** is marked down if the tax expense (i.e. recorded in financial accounting) < tax payable (i.e. recorded in tax reporting) since the company paid "less tax" in this period may have to be paid in the future.

##### Deferred tax liability scenario
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.18.51.png]]

### Deferred tax asset (DTA)
**Deferred tax asset (DTA)** is created if the tax expense > tax payable, then the balance sheet record the extra amount in DTA since the "excess tax" has been paid in this period may be a future benefit.

##### Deferred tax asset scenario
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.23.22.png]]

The **income tax expense** can be presented in this equation:
$$\mathrm{Income\,tax\,expense=Tax\,payable+\Delta DTL-\Delta DTA}$$
where tax expense: financial accounting tax expense; tax payable: tax reporting tax payable based on tax rules; DTL: deferred tax liability; DTA: deferred tax asset

The **accounting profit** is in the income statement of the company, the **tax expense** includes **cash taxes** and **deferred taxes** are also in the income statement.

The **taxable income** is the income that are subjected to tax by authorities, and the value can be different from the **accounting profit**, and the **tax payable** is the actual tax liability for this current period.

## Financial accounting and tax reporting source differences
The **source of differences** can be **permanent** or **temporary**.  

In **permanent** cases, such differences will not reverse over time. The permanent differences will not affect by accounting profit in the income statement. This will cause the company to pay the **tax payable**, rather than the tax expense (**statutory tax rate**).

There are differences between **statuary** and **effective tax rate**:
- **statutory tax rate** - is the tax rate set out by the tax authority
- **effective tax rate** - is the tax expense over the pre-tax profit (i.e. $\mathrm{Tax\,expense/Pretax\,profit}$)

Therefore, the statutory tax rate does not equal to the effective tax rate.

The **effective tax rate equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Effective\,income\,tax\,rate=\frac{Tax\,expense}{Acconting\,profit}}$$
Since there will be **no reversal** over time, there are no future benefit or obligation, so it is **not** marked on the balance sheet as deferred tax asset (DTA) and deferred tax liability (DTL).

## Deferred tax assets (DTA) and deferred tax liabilities (DTL)
However, in the cases of **temporary**, which arises due to **timing differences**, the differences will likely reverse over time. Therefore, there is a future benefit or obligation, and thus **marked** on the **balance sheet** as **deferred tax asset (DTA)** and **deferred tax liability (DTL)**.

## Tax base
The timing differences caused by the different valuation method between financial accounting and tax reporting system.

On the balance sheet, the accounting might want to use a straight-line method for calculating accumulated depreciation/amortisation. Whereas the tax authority would like to use the double declining balance method, which result in a greater cost and lesser **carrying value** to the next year. 

The **carrying value** is the value of asset, net of depreciation/amortisation. 
The **tax base** is the amount deductible for tax purposes in future periods.

If carrying value $\ne$ tax base, there will be a DTL or DTA.

##### Double Declining Balance method
The equation for double declining balance method is as follows: $$\mathrm{DDB\,Depreciation = \frac {2}{Useful\,life} \times (Cost-Accumulated\,depreciation)}$$ where $Cost - Accumulated\,depreciation$ is also known as the net book value, and depreciation stops when net book value reaches residual value.

### Example for differences in accounting and tax methods

Through the calculation of financial accounting and tax reporting:
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.50.26.png]]

Through calculating the **carrying value** and **tax base** (quicker way to calculate DTA/DTL):
1. Calculate the **carrying value** of the asset or liability by applying the financial accounting method (net of any applicable depreciation or amortisation).
2. Calculate the tax base of the asset or liability using the tax rules and regulations, (net of different depreciation or amortisation methods depending on the tax requirement).
3. Determine the difference between the **carrying value** and the **tax base** (i.e. $\mathrm{Carrying\,value-Tax\,base}$). If the carrying value is higher than the tax base, it creates a deductible temporary difference and may result in a DTL. If the carrying value is lower than the tax base, it creates a taxable temporary difference and may result in a DTA.
4. **Multiply** the difference by the **statutory tax rate** to calculate the amount of DTA or DTL that should be recognized in the financial statements.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.53.13.png]]

**Note**: The tax overpaid or less paid are reversed over the years as the tax expense and tax payable are equatable. Also, both methods have the same ending value of DTL.

### Deferred tax liability by carrying value and tax base
**Deferred tax liability (DTL)** - the carrying value is higher than the tax base, it creates a deductible temporary difference and may result in a DTL.

The **deferred tax liability (DTL)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTL =(Carrying\,value-Tax\,base)\times Tax\,rate}$$
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.54.48.png]]

### Deferred tax asset by carrying value and tax base
**Deferred tax asset (DTA)** - if the carrying value is lower than the tax base, it creates a taxable temporary difference and may result in a DTA.

The **deferred tax asset (DTA)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DTA =(Tax\,base-Carrying\,value)\times Tax\,rate}$$
![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 19.54.59.png]]

## Tax loss carry-forward
**Tax loss carry-forward** refers to a **tax provision (i.e. defer tax)** in the tax system that allows businesses or individuals to use losses incurred in previous years to reduce their taxable income in future years.

When a business or individual incurs expenses or losses that exceed their income in a particular tax year, it results in a **net operating loss**. This loss can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years, which can lead to a reduction in the amount of taxes owed (i.e. **tax loss carry-forward is a form of DTA**). The deferred tax assets are beneficial only if the company is profitable in future.

![[Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 20.00.17.png]]

## Valuation adjustments
A **valuation allowance adjustment** is made to reflect the probability that a **tax loss carry-forward, a type of Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) will not be realised in the future**.  If it is more likely than not that the DTA will not be realised, a valuation allowance is established.

**Valuation allowance adjustment** is for:
- Consecutive losses or a history of losses raise doubts about a company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilise its Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (aka. tax loss carry-forward) effectively.
- Accounting standards require the company to assess the likelihood of realising the tax benefits associated with the DTA in such cases.
- Required under **US GAAP** when the probability is **>50%** of some or all the DTA may not be realised, the DTA must include valuation allowance 
- Contra account that reduces net DTA - **Increasing the valuation allowance decreases the net DTA**, leading to an **increase in the current income tax expense, a reduction in net income**, **offsets (reduces) assets**, and **reduces equity**. (i.e. â†‘ Valuation allowance â‡’ â†“ Net DTA â‡’ â†‘ Tax Expense â‡’ â†“ Net income)
- Decreasing the valuation allowance in future periods (can be reversed if circumstances changed) has the opposite effect, increasing future net income. 
- Can be used to manipulate earnings - A valuation allowance is a contra account (offset) against deferred tax assets that reflects the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will never be realised. Changes in the valuation allowance have a direct impact on reported income. Because management has discretion with regard to the amount and timing of a valuation allowance, changes in the valuation allowance give management significant opportunity to manage earnings.

## Tax rate changes
**Tax rate changes** from time to time, then according to that DTA and DTL changes over time as well, and that will affect the tax expenses.

When the tax rate â†‘, there is going to be â†‘ DTA and â†‘ DTL. 
When the tax rate â†“, there is going to be â†“ DTA and â†“ DTL.
The **net effect** depends on whether the DTA or DTL is higher.

**Net effect of income tax expense**:

|Tax rate change|DTA or DTL| Tax expense|
|----|----|----|
|Tax rate â†‘|DTA is higher |â†“ Tax expense|
|Tax rate â†‘|DTL is higher |â†‘ Tax expense|
|Tax rate â†“|DTA is lower|â†‘ Tax expense|
|Tax rate â†“|DTL is lower|â†“ Tax expense|

### Example for calculation of DTA and DTL with change in tax rate

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 01.41.24.png]]

The difference in DTA or DTL with change of tax rate: 
$$\mathrm{\Delta DTA\,or\,\Delta DTL = \frac{(New\,tax\,rate-Old\,tax\,rate)}{Old\,tax\,rate}\times DT}$$
where DT: deferred tax amount.

## Temporary differences
Besides depreciation method of PP&E which have been discussed in the previous section, there are other common sources of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting:
- **Depreciation method of PP&E**
- **Impairment of assets**
- **Restructuring costs**
- **Inventory cost flow method**
- **Post-employment benefits/deferred compensation**
- **Unrealised gains/losses from AS securities**
- **Bad debt expense**
- **Warranty expense**
- **Dividends from subsidiary**

One simple way to determine whether a DTA or DTL is created, is to compare the initial tax payable with the income tax expense.

These cells highlighted in yellow have a lower initial tax deduction than tax expense. This means that the higher tax paid upfront will reverse in the future, and thus a deferred tax asset is created.

Conversely, these cells highlighted in green have a higher initial tax expense than tax payables. This means that the accounting profit is higher, translating to lower initial tax payable. The lower tax paid upfront will reverse in the future, and thus a deferred tax liability is created.

#### Summary of common sources of temporary differences
![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 01.55.56.png]]
_Note_: for the **dividends from subsidiary**, DTL is not reported if parent controls timing of reversal or if timing difference is unlikely to reverse

## Required disclosures
Companies are required to disclose details of all these sources of temporary differences
that cause DTA and DTL to be reported on the balance sheet.

Typically, the following deferred tax information is disclosed: 
- **Deferred tax liabilities (DTL), deferred tax assets (DTA), any valuation allowance**, and the net change in the valuation allowance over the period.
- Any unrecognized deferred tax liability for **undistributed earnings of subsidiaries** and joint ventures. 
- **Current year tax effect** of each type of temporary difference.
- The **components** of income tax expense.
- **Reconciliation** of reported income tax expense, and the tax expense based on the statutory rate.
- **Tax loss carry forwards** and credits

## Key differences in income tax accounting between IFRS vs US GAAP
There are several key differences in income tax accounting between **IFRS** and **US GAAP**:
- **Revaluation of assets**
- **Undistributed profit from a subsidiary, joint venture, or an associate firm**
- **Recognition of deferred tax assets**
- **Presentation of deferred taxes on balance sheet**

### Revaluation of assets
**Revaluation of assets** is allowed under **IFRS**, but **not US GAAP**. As such, there is the possibility that the asset is valued using **fair value instead of historical cost under IFRS**.
If that is the case, the carrying value and tax base of the asset may not be the same, giving rise to deferred taxes.

#### Undistributed profit from a subsidiary, joint venture or an associate firm
Do be aware that there are differences, but you don't have to go too much into detail.

#### Recognition of deferred tax assets
**Under IFRS**, deferred tax assets are **recognized only if it is probable that the firm will be profitable** in the future to recover the tax asset. 
Under **US GAAP,** deferred tax assets are **recognized in full initially**, **reduced by valuation allowance if recovery becomes improbable**.

#### Presentation of deferred taxes on balance sheet
For **US GAAP**, it requires a distinction of **current and non-current deferred tax**. **Next period** between reversals go into **current**, while **reversals after more than one period go into non-current**.
For **IFRS**, the **full amount of deferred tax goes into non-current**, regardless of the timings of the reversals.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 02.02.02.png]]

The key to tackling this difficult topic is to focus on the basics, be clear about the differences between taxable and pre-tax income, and be prepared to calculate taxes payable, tax expense, deferred tax liabilities, and assets.

## Financial analysis of deferred tax
For financial analysis, an analyst must decide on the appropriate treatment of deferred taxes on a case-by-case basis. These can be classified as liabilities or stockholder's equity, depending on various factors. Sometimes, deferred taxes are just ignored altogether.
