## The concept of market efficiency
### Definition of market efficiency
An **efficient market** is one in which asset prices **reflect new information** **quickly and rationally**. If we look at it from the perspective of statistics, this means that current market prices are **unbiased estimates of their values**. The **expected return** on any asset is just the equilibrium return necessary to compensate investors for the **risk** regarding its future cash flows. Put it bluntly, "you can't beat the market".

#### Perfectly efficient market
In a **perfectly efficient** market:
- investors should use a **passive investment strategy**, which is to buy a broad market index of stocks and hold it.
- **active investment** strategies will underperform due to **transaction costs** and **management fees**.

However, not all market participants believe that markets are perfectly efficient.

#### Not-perfectly efficient market
This is why there are plenty of **active investors** that believe **positive risk-adjusted returns** can be generated by employing strategies that **exploit market inefficiencies**.

One method of measuring a market's efficiency:
- determine the **lag** from the time the **new information is disseminated** to the time prices reflect the implications of that information 
- In some very efficient markets, e.g. foreign currency markets, this lag can be as short as a minute.
- If there is a significant lag form, traders can use the information to potentially generate positive risk-adjusted returns.


Note that new information refers to information that is **unexpected** and **changes expectations** on the **future performance of the company**, only new information that is unexpected should move prices. New information that is well anticipated should not move prices.

### Market value vs intrinsic value
The **market value** of an asset is its current price. **Intrinsic value** or **fundamental value i**s, the value that would be placed on it by investors if they had a complete understanding of the assets investment characteristics.

In **not completely efficient market**, active investors can believe that there's a **discrepancy between the market and intrinsic values**.

The **real intrinsic value cannot be known with certainty**, and they can be vastly different estimates by different investors and analysts.

â†‘ complexity of the instrument â‡’ difficult to estimate the intrinsic value

**Market value** of an asset represents the intersection of supply and demand from investors who have different estimates of the intrinsic value. Since information relevant to valuation flows continually to investors, **estimates of intrinsic value change** and hence **market values change**.

In a perfectly efficient market, however, investors are able to fully and quickly react to new information, the market value should reflect the actual intrinsic values.

### Factors that affect market efficiency
In practice, **markets are neither perfectly efficient nor completely inefficient**, market efficiency should be **viewed as a continuum** between completely inefficient and perfectly efficient. The degree of efficiency can vary across **countries**, **time** and **market types**.

The following factors affect the degree of market efficiency:
- **The number of market participants** - the larger the more efficient, the participants will act quickly when there are mispricing â‡’ opportunities are rare
- **The availability of information** - the more information is available to investors, the more efficient the market. (e.g. NYSE is quite efficient; emerging markets and OTC market instruments e.g. bonds, currencies, swaps, forwards, mortgages and money market securities, the availability of information is lower and consequently market prices are relatively less efficient)
	- Market regulators should make sure that access to information should not favour one party over another, United States SEC requires that firms disclose the same information to the public that they disclose to stock analysts;  traders with material inside information about a firm are also prohibited from trading on that information.
- **Impediments to trading arbitrage** -  buying an asset in one market and simultaneously selling it at a higher price in another market. Impediments to arbitrage, such as high transaction costs or lack of information, will limit arbitrage activity and allow mispricing of assets to persist.
- **Restriction of short selling** - including high cost to borrow stocks, ban on short selling â‡’ prevents or slows market prices from reaching their intrinsic value; perfectly efficient market will have ease for short-selling and the sales pressure from short selling will prevent the asset from becoming over valued
- **Transaction and information costs** - high transaction cost impediments to trade â‡’ inhibits arbitrage and short selling; hight acquisition cost for information â‡’ â†“ trading activity as investors stay out

## Efficient market hypothesis
The **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** was originally developed by Professor Eugene **Fama**.

According to the theory, markets are efficient when prices reflect all relevant information at any point in time. 

Such relevant information can be categorised as three distinct sets:
- **All relevant information** - refers to all public information + all private information only the insiders or management knows.
- **All public information** -  includes financial statement, data, company announcements, analyst reports and past market data.
- **Past market data** - all historical price and trading volume information

### Weak form of market efficiency
**Weak form of market efficiency** states that current market prices fully reflect **all past market data**. This implies that investors cannot predict future price changes by historical prices, patterns of prices, volume information from the past. 
Â 
In other words, investors **cannot achieve excess (positive risk-adjusted returns) returns** using **technical analysis**.

### Semi-strong form of market efficiency
**Semi strong form** of market efficiency states that **security prices instantly adjust** to **reflect all publicly known and available information**. This implies that based on public information such as earnings, dividends and various accounting ratios and estimates cannot predict the future prices.

In other words, investors **cannot achieve excess (positive risk-adjusted returns) returns** using **fundamental analysis**.

### Strong form of market efficiency
**Strong form of market efficiency** is the highest level of market efficiency. In such a market, **security prices fully reflect both public and private information**. Assumes that perfect markets in which all information is cost free and available to everyone at the same time. This implies that even insiders with material, private information would not be able to earn abnormal returns as the price is already fully reflect the implications of the insider information.

However, this is not likely because given the prohibition on insider trading in most markets, it would be **unrealistic to expect markets to reflect all private information**. Evidence suggests that **markets are not strong form efficient**.

In other words, investors **cannot achieve excess (positive risk-adjusted returns) returns** even with **insider trading**.

### Hypothesis of market form
These are the three efficient market hypothesis that we can use to test the level of efficiency of a market. To recap, if a test is able to reject the $H_0$, then we can prove certain % confidence that the $H_A$ is true. Such tests can include the use of **abnormal profit** calculations. 

**Abnormal profits** are positive risk-adjusted returns calculated by subtracting the expected return for a trading strategy given its risk from its actual returns.

The **abnormal profit (positive risk-adjusted returns)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Abnormal\,profits=Actual\,return-Expected\,return}$$
where the expected return is given risk.

$H_0$: abnormal profits $\le$ 0, which is the case for an efficient market
$H_A$: abnormal profits > 0, which is inefficient market

If the abnormal profit is found statistically not lower, we can **reject the $H_0$** of efficient prices with respect to the information on which the strategy is based ($H_A$ is true with a certain level of confidence).

### Efficient market hypothesis and technical analysis
To test the efficient market hypothesis, we can test **trading strategies** based on **technical analysis**. 

Tests have shown that technical analysis does not produce abnormal profits, so we cannot reject the hypothesis that markets are weak form efficient.

This is at least so for the stock markets of developed nations, implying that they are weak form efficient. However, there are so many possible technical analysis, trading strategies that they cannot all be tested, so **this is still inconclusive**.

Moreover, **technical analysis** has been shown to **have some success in emerging markets**. This may imply that emerging markets **may not be as weak form efficient** as the developed markets.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 16.58.59.png]]

### Efficient market hypothesis and fundamental analysis  
To test for semi-strong form efficient markets, we can test trading strategies based on **fundamental analysis**.

One method of testing is an **event study**, **abnormal returns** is based on the **actual return on an event date** and the **estimated expected return for the event**.

**Event** can be: release of **new information** that affects a firm's **intrinsic value** (e.g. **earnings announcements or dividend changes**)

$H_0$: abnormal profits $\le$ 0; no abnormal profits by trading based on the events
$H_A$abnormal profits > 0, which is inefficient market

The evidence in **developed markets indicates that markets are generally semi strong form efficient**. However, there is evidence of **semi strong form inefficiency in some emerging markets**.

### Conclusion of efficient market hypothesis 
There are several conclusions to be made:
- Markets are generally **weak-form efficient** (except emerging markets)
- Markets are generally **semi-strong form efficient** (except emerging markets)
- Markets are not strong form efficient - as strict laws that prohibit insider trading, so market prices are unlikely to reflect private information.

So both fundamental and technical analysis is unlikely to produce abnormal returns. So what do all these mean to an investor?

If markets are weak form and semi strong form efficient, the implication is that **active trading, whether it's using fundamental or technical analysis, is not likely to generate abnormal returns**.

The role of a portfolio manager:
- is not necessarily to beat the market, but rather to establish and manage a portfolio consistent with the portfolio's objectives
- portfolio diversification, 
- asset allocation according to their risk profile and tax management.

## Market Anomalies
An efficient market hypothesis test (EMH) is one in which the **$H_0$ hypothesis** is that **markets are efficient** and that **no abnormal profits can be made**.

$H_0$: Markets are efficient, and abnormal profits $\le$ 0.
$H_A$: Markets are inefficient.

Let's say an analyst is able to apply some **trading strategy** on historical data, the abnormal profits $\le$ 0 at 5% level of significance (i.e. p<0.05), the **$H_0$ hypothesis** is **rejected** and the analyst has **found an anomaly**. This **anomaly** (trading alpha) could potentially be a **key to earning abnormal returns in the market**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.09.36.png]]

### Factors to consider with market anomalies
There are several factors of the market anomalies that should be considered:
- **Anomaly may not persist in future** - past relationship may not imply persistence
- **Possibility of Type I error** - reject $H_0$ when it is actually true
- **Data mining bias** - keep on testing the same data until a statistically significant outcome is found
	 To avoid data mining bias:
	 - Through understanding whether there's any economic basis
	 - Large data set
- 

### Time series anomalies
There are several time-series anomalies, namely calendar anomalies and overreaction and momentum anomalies:
- **January effect**
- **Turn-of-the-month effect** - where stock returns are higher in the days surrounding month end.
- **Day-of-the-week effect** - average Monday returns are negative.
- **Weekend effect** - positive Friday returns are followed by negative Monday returns.
- **Holiday effect** - pre-holiday returns are higher.
- **Overreaction and momentum anomalies** - violation of weak-form EMH as abnormal profit based on past market data

While all of these anomalies have shown up in the past, they've been shown to be eliminated over time.

#### January effect
The **January effect** or **turn of the year effect** is the finding that during the **first five trading days of January, stock returns are significantly higher** than they are the rest of the year.

This is an **anomaly** because in an efficient market, traders would exploit this by buying ahead, which pushes prices up and selling at the end of it, pushing prices down. In doing so, the profit opportunity is eliminated. So what can explain the January effect?

Possible explanations:
- **Tax loss selling** - investors sell losing positions in December to **realize losses for tax purposes** and then repurchase stocks in January
- **Window dressing** - portfolio managers sell risky stocks in December to make their year end holdings report **appear less risky** and repurchase them in January.

Recent evidence suggests that the January effect is not persistent and therefore is not a pricing anomaly. What's an appropriate adjustment for risk is made, the January effect does not produce abnormal returns.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.21.46.png]]

#### Momentum strategy
**Momentum** effects relate to short term share price patterns, where high short term returns are followed by continued high returns. The strategy is, therefore, to trade in the direction of the market, which in this case is to long in expectation of higher prices.
i.e. trade in the same direction as the market

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.22.02.png|400]]

#### Overreaction strategy
The **overreaction effect** is similar in that when a company releases positive information, the stock price can outperform the market for a long period of time in a way that is out of line from the fundamentals. The explanation is that investors overreacted to the good news, so the **proposed strategy** is to **short** such stocks as the stock price will eventually go back to its intrinsic value.
i.e. trade in the opposite direction as the market

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.22.19.png|400]]


### Cross-sectional anomalies
There are several cross-sectional anomalies:
- **Size effect** - returns on small-cap stocks > returns on large-cap stocks; could not be confirmed in later studies suggesting that it could have been eliminated as investors traded on it, or that the initial finding was simply a random result for the time period examined
- **Value effect** - returns on value stocks > returns on growth stocks (greater risk of value stocks that is not captured in the risk adjustment procedure used in the studies.)
	- where value stocks are low P/E, high dividend; growth stocks are high P/E, low dividends

Both the size, effect and value effect violate the semi strong form of market efficiency, because all the the information are publicly available.

### Other anomalies
There are different types of other anomalies:
- **Close-end investment funds**
- **Earning surprise**
- **Initial public offerings**

#### Close end investment funds
Closed end investment funds hold a portfolio of securities, so their trading price should be very close to the net asset value of all the securities held. In practice, however, several closed end funds trade at large discounts to the NAV

This is an anomaly because an **arbitrageur** can earn abnormal profit by shorting the portfolio of stocks, buying the fund and pocketing the difference.

Some possible explanations for the discount are:
- management fees
- taxes on future capital gains
- illiquidity of the fund's shares

However, they still do not fully explain the pricing discrepancy. In any case, transactions costs would eliminate any profits from exploiting these unexplained portion of discount.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.33.05.png]]

#### Earning surprise
**Earnings surprises** can also create anomalies in a market. In an efficient market, an earnings announcement **should create** an **instantaneous jump** in price to the **new intrinsic value** such that there is **no abnormal profit to be made after the announcement**.

In reality, the adjustment process can be over a period of time such that traders **can make abnormal profit over this adjustment period**.

Some researchers argue that this is merely a result of incorrectly estimating risk adjusted returns in the tests and that transactions costs would eliminate any abnormal profits.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.33.21.png]]

#### Initial public offering (IPO)
When a company first issue stocks to the public, the **offering price is often underpriced** as the **company wants to avoid under subscription**.

The result is that the price jumps on the first trading day. The evidence suggests that **investors who are able to buy the shares of an IPO at their offering price may be able to earn abnormal profits**.

In addition, the evidence also suggests that investors buying after the initial offering are not able to earn abnormal profits because prices adjust quickly to their intrinsic values, which supports semi strong market efficiency.

They suggest that investors **overreact** in that they are too optimistic about the firm's prospects on the offer day.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 19.35.43.png]]

### Reasons why it is difficult to profit from market anomalies
- **Anomalies are due to the methodologies used in the tests** - abnormal profit can be attributed to inadequate risk adjustment by the researcher
- **Under-reaction and overreaction have been found in the markets** â‡’ prices are efficient on average
- **Anomalies have been shown to not persist over time**
- **Taking into account of transaction costs, some profits are too small**

## Behavioural finance
### Traditional finance vs behavioural finance
**Traditional finance**, there is an assumption of investors **consider all available information** and **make rational decisions** in the market by **maximising utility** within budget constraints. Under this assumption, market prices are rational, which supports the theory that markets are efficient and that no abnormal profits can be made.

**Behavioural finance**, on the other hand, does not make any of these assumptions. Investors are **selective with information** and **make irrational market decisions**. If investor rationality is viewed as a prerequisite for market efficiency, then **markets are not efficient**.

### Pricing anomalies
Such irrational behaviour, in particular, their behavioural biases, has been offered as a possible explanation for a number of **pricing anomalies**, which in turn is an argument against market efficiency.

### Investor rationality and market efficiency
The correctness of this argument depends on the two ways of interpreting **market efficiency**:
- If **investor rationality** is a prerequisite for market efficiency, then markets **are not efficient**.
- If market efficiency only requires that **investors cannot consistently earn abnormal profits**, then **research supports the belief that markets are efficient**. That is, the **market as a whole is still efficient**, even when individual investors make irrational decisions. These responses bring **market prices** **in line with their intrinsic values** and **eliminate any abnormal profi**t to be made.

### Behaviours and biases that are evidence of irrational decisions
There are several behaviours and biases:
- **Loss aversion** - the tendency of investors to dislike a loss more than they like, a gain of an equal amount (do not confuse with **risk aversion** in traditional finance; the tendency of investors requiring higher expected returns to compensate for additional risk â‡’ this is rational behaviour)
- **Overconfidence** - the tendency of investors to **overestimate** their **ability to process and interpret information** about a security) if there is a sufficient number of these investors, stocks will be mispriced, but most researchers believe it will be corrected eventually)
- **Herding** - tendency of investors to **act in concert** on the same side of the market
- **Information cascade** - similar to herding in that investors watch and follow the actions of other investors (some however, argue that this may support the argument for efficient markets. If participants are knowledgeable investors, those who follow their actions may be part of the process of moving prices toward their intrinsic values.)
