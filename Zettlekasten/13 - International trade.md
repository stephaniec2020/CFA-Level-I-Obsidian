## International trade
### Definitions
**International trade** are 

**Imports** are goods and services that firms, individuals and governments purchase from producers in other countries. **Exports** are goods and services that firms, individuals and governments from other countries purchase from domestic producers.

**Net exports** is the value of a country's exports, minus the value of its imports over some period (X-M). There is a **trade surplus** when **net exports are positive**, and a **trade deficit** when **net exports are negative**.

### Autarky (closed) economy
A country that does not trade with other countries is an **autarky** or **closed economy**. **Trade protection** is when a government places restrictions, limits or charges on exports or imports.

**Free trade** is when a government places no restrictions or charges on import and export activity.

The **world price** is the price of a good or service in world markets **under free trade**. 

**Domestic price** refers to the price of a good or service in the **domestic country**, and if a country practices free trade, the **domestic price** = **world price**. However, if the country has **trade protection/restrictions**, then the **domestic price** $\ne$ **world price**.

**Terms of trade** is the **ratio of price index** for Exports over price index for imports, it is expressed with a base value of 100:
$$\mathrm{Terms\,of\,trade=\frac{Price\,index\,for\,Exports}{Price\,index\,for\,Imports} \times100}$$
This means that the prices of exports have risen by a certain percent relative to the prices of imports since the base period.

### GDP vs GNP
**Gross domestic product (GDP)** is the total value of goods and services produced **within a country's borders** in a given period.

**Gross national product (GNP)** is similar, but measures the total value of goods and services **produced by the labor and capital of a country citizens**. 

The difference is due to **incomes of foreigners** and the **income of foreign capital invested** in the country, which are included in GDP but not in GNP. The **income of citizens who work in other countries** and the **income of capital supplied by its citizens** to foreign countries which are included in GNP but not in GDP.

**GDP** is more related to economic activity within a country, which in turn affects:
- employment
- economic growth

### Benefits and costs of trade
There are some benefits of trade:
- benefits from cheaper goods
- increased employment and income

There are some costs of trade:
- domestic industries that compete with imported goods
- might cause the domestic workers losing their jobs
- although there may be short term and medium term costs, these resources are likely to be reemployed in more productive industries in the long run.

Nevertheless, the proponents of trade argue that the benefits of trade outweigh the costs for economies as a whole so that the winners can compensate the losers and still be better off.

### Absolute advantage vs comparative advantage
When comparing two countries, the country that can produce a good at a lower resource cost than the other country is said to have **absolute advantage** in producing the good.

The country that can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than the other country is said to have the **comparative advantage**, this opportunity cost is expressed as the amount of another good that could have been produced instead.

Let's put this question aside first and study this in terms of opportunity cost.

To calculate the opportunity cost, divide the amount of the other good that a worker could have produced by the amount of this good that a worker can produce.

The equation of opportunity cost:
$$\mathrm{Opportunity\,cost = \frac{Amount\,of\,other\,good\,a\,worker\,could\,have\,produced}{Amount\,of\,this\,good\,a\,worker\,produces}}$$

We can call this the **production possibility frontier**, the slope of the frontier measures the opportunity cost of other good over this good. Since we have a straight line, the assumption is that the opportunity cost is constant. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 16.55.53.png]]

However, for most products, the **marginal cost** increases as production levels increase.This means that the **opportunity cost** should be higher, so the slope should be steeper as production increases. The opportunity cost is therefore not constant. More likely, the production possibility frontier is a curve as shown, and the marginal cost is the slope of the curve at each level of production.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 16.57.08.png]]

More likely, the production possibility frontier is a curve as shown, and the marginal cost is the slope of the curve at each level of production. If the production level is higher, the opportunity cost is higher.

The combined production figures for both countries are now higher. Both countries share these gains, but the proportions would depend on a negotiated terms between them. The important analysis here is that **even if a country did not have an absolute advantage** in the production of any good, it **could still gain from trade if it had a comparative advantage** in the production of a good.

### Models of trade
There are different models of trade, which they consider various aspects:
- Ricardinan model of trade
- Heckscher-Ohlin model

#### Ricardian model
This analysis is credited to David Ricardo, whose model is called the Ricardian Model of Trade.

As you would have observed, this model has only one factor of production, which is labor.According to Ricardo, the differences in **labor productivity** are due to differences in **technology.** 

#### Heckscher-Ohlin model
A country with lower opportunity cost in the production of a good has a comparative advantage in that good and will specialise in its production.

Differences in the relative amounts of labour vs capital are the source of a country's comparative advantage. Redistribution of wealth within each country between the labour force and the owners of the capital. When there is trade, the good that a country imports (exports) will fall (rise) in price.

The labor force benefits as jackets are more labor intensive at the expense of the owners of capital.

## Trade restrictions and trade agreements
### Types of trade restrictions
**Trade restrictions** is a type of trade protection where government policies that limit trade with other countries.
There are several types of trade restrictions:
- **Tariffs** - Taxes collected by the government on imported goods
- **Quotas** - Limits on the amount of imports allowed for each period
- **Voluntary export restraints** - Some exporting countries voluntarily restrict the amount of a good that can be exported
- **Export subsidy** - Paying producers a certain amount for every unit exported

### Economic implications
#### Free market without imports
In a free market, there is always a demand and supply curve without imports. The market equilibrium, output and price of the good will be at this point.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.27.30.png | 500 ]]

#### Free market with imports allowed
If imports are allowed without restrictions, the **market price = world price** for the good. Since the domestic producers cannot produce enough to meet demand at this price point, the remaining quantity is imported. The **domestic producer surplus** is this portion below the market price and along with domestic supply line. The **consumer surplus** below the domestic demand to the market price portion here. Between the domestic output and quantity demanded portion here goes to **foreign suppliers**.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.27.55.png]]

#### Market with imports allowed but with government tariffs
If the government imposes a tariff on the good, this tariff is most likely passed on to the consumers, so the **market price rise by the tariff amount**.

At this price, **domestic producers want to supply more so domestic output increases**. The **demand by consumers is lower, so the amount of imports is reduced**.

You will have noticed that the biggest casualty of a tariff is the consumer, as the amount of **consumer surplus is greatly reduced**. The **domestic producers surplus increases** as they sell more at a higher price. The government takes this portion here, which is the amount of tariffs collected and increases government revenue. 

However, notice these two empty portions, which are the **dead weight loss**, and it implies that national welfare is reduced. 

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.28.15.png]]

#### Market with imports allowed but with quota
A **quota** has the same effect as a **tariff**. When the amount of imports is limited to a level lower than the domestic demand, the **domestic price increases above the world price**.

This has the exact same effect as tariffs in **lowering consumer surplus**, **increasing producer surplus** and **reducing national welfare**.

The only difference is where this portion known as the quota rent goes, a quota can be implemented by issuing import licences to foreign suppliers.

If the licenses are free, then the entire quota rent goes to foreign suppliers.

If foreign suppliers are required to pay or bid for the licenses, then a portion or all of the quota rent goes to the government of the importing country.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.37.15.png]]

#### Market with imports allowed but with voluntary export restraints 
**Voluntary export restraints** are very similar to a quota, except that this limit is self-imposed by the exporting country government.

Voluntary export restraints are voluntarily agreed upon between exporting and importing nations.

In a way, this can be seen as the exporting countries attempt to capture the quota rent rather than to let the importing country have it.



![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.39.24.png]]

#### Market with imports allowed but with export subsidy
**Export subsidies** affect the exporting country more than the importing country.

A country will export a good if at the world price, the quantity demanded by the domestic consumers is lower than what the producers can supply.

By subsidizing the producers for exporting, the producers can produce more to export so the domestic price increases by the subsidy amount.

The **producer surplus is increased** at the **expense of consumer surplus**. This is also at the **expense of taxpayers as government revenue** is spent on the subsidies.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 17.40.29.png]]

#### Reasons behind trade restrictions
There could be many reasons for trade restrictions, but some of the justifications are: 
- Protecting domestic industries from foreign competition
- Protecting new industries from foreign competition until they mature (infant industry)
- Protecting and increasing domestic employment
- Protecting strategic industries for national security reasons
- Significant sources of revenue for developing countries
- Retaliation against trade restrictions imposed by other countries

### Trade agreements
To break down trade restrictions, countries negotiate with each other various forms of **trade agreements** such that all involved countries can benefit from free trade.

We list these types of agreements generally referred to as trading blocs or regional trading agreements in order of their degrees of integration.

#### Free trade area
A **free trade area** is one where there are **no barriers to import and export of goods and services** among member countries.
E.g. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

#### Customs union
A **customs union** is that plus the requirement that **all countries adopt a common set of trade restrictions with nonmembers**.

#### Common market
A **common market** is all that, plus **free movement of labour and capital goods among member countries**, e.g. **Southern Cone Common Market** of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay is an example of a common market.

#### Economic Union
An **economic union** is all that, plus the requirement of **common institutions and economic policy** for the Union, the European Union is one such example.

#### Monetary union
And the most integrated block is the monetary union, **which also requires member countries to adopt a single currency**. The Eurozone is a monetary union where the common currency is the euro.

While the removal of trade restrictions can in most cases improve economic welfare within the member nations, such welfare gains can be reduced if restrictions on trade with non-member countries shuts off cheaper sources of imports for the country.

## Capital restrictions
**Capital restrictions** are policies aimed at **controlling the flow of financial capital across borders**. Economists consider free movement of financial capital to be beneficial because it allows capital to be invested where it'll earn the highest return. So overall, capital restrictions are thought to decrease economic welfare in both the sources and recipients of capital.

There are two types of capital restrictions:
- **Capital inflow restrictions** - foreigners ability to own domestic assets or 
- **Capital outflow restrictions** - domestic residents ability to own foreign assets

Such controls are placed on . In contrast with trade restrictions which limit the openness of goods markets, **capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets**.

#### Restrictions on capital inflow
**Restrictions on capital inflow** can include:
- **outright prohibition of foreign investment** in the domestic economy
- requiring majority domestic ownership of certain firms
- prohibition of foreign investment in certain domestic industries.

#### Restrictions on capital outflow
**Restrictions on capital outflow** can include:
- taxes on income earned on foreign investments by domestic citizens
- restrictions on repatriation of earnings by foreign firms

#### Reasons for placing capital restrictions
Despite the negative impact, some governments place capital restrictions for various reasons:
- **Maintain fixed exchange rate** - â†“ capital flows, â†“ volatility of currency demand â‡’ easier to meet exchange rate target for central bank; monetary and fiscal policy more effective.
- **Keep domestic interest rate low** - restrict capital outflows â‡’ investors unable to shift money out to pursue higher rates â‡’ domestic interest rates stable/low
- **Protect strategic industries** - foreign entities restricted from investing in domestic firms important for national security
- **Reduce volatility of asset prices (for relatively small financial markets)** - massive inflows â‡’ inflationary pressures; massive outflows â‡’ stock market crashes

Economists agree that while capital restrictions can fix certain problems in the short run, the long term costs can outweigh the short term benefits, especially lower price volatility. International investors may lose confidence in the domestic financial market and divert their investments elsewhere.

Capital restrictions may lower price volatility in the short-run, but in the long run, foreign investors shun the country, the wealth and economic growth foregone foreign investments is a far heavier cost to the country.

## Balance of payments
### Balance of payment systems
**Balance of payments** is a bookkeeping system that summarises a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world for a particular period. The balance of payments have 3 different accounts:
- **Current account** - measure the flow of goods and services
- **Capital account** - measure transfers of capital
- **Financial account** - records investment flows

### Components
#### Current account
Under current account, there are sub-accounts of:
- **Merchandise trade** - import/export of commodities and goods
- **Services** - tourism, transportation, engineering, business services etc.
- **Income receipts** - income derived from ownership of assets (dividends and interest)
- **Unilateral transfers** - one way transfers of assets (remittances, foreign aid, gifts)

#### Capital account
Under capital account, there are sub-accounts of:
- **Non-produced, non-financial assets** - imports/exports of non-produced, financial assets (also include sales/purchases of intangible asset)
- **Capital transfers** - debt forgiveness, assets that migrants bring when they come, or take them when they leave
Size of the capital account is often insignificant.

#### Financial account
Under financial account, there are sub-accounts of:
- **Financial assets abroad** - official reserve, government assets, private assets
	- gold, foreign currencies, securities, direct foreign investment, claims on foreign entities (i.e. ownership of foreign bonds, claims against foreign entities)
- **Foreign-owned financial assets** - official assets, other foreign assets
	- government/corporate bonds, direct investment, and liabilities to foreign entities (i.e. ownership of local bonds by foreign entities, foreign claims on local entities)

### Balance of payments and double-entry
Besides the components, another important aspect of balance of payments is the double entry system in which every transaction involves both a debit and credit.

So in theory, the total amount of debit must equal total amount of credit for the same period. In essence, a debit represents an increase in a country's assets or a decrease in its liabilities, while a credit is the opposite.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 23.47.56.png]]
In essence, **one transaction results in a debit and credit entry in the balance of payments**, and **they may not necessarily be in the same account**. However, the **total debits and total credits should theoretically be equal**.

#### Current account deficit
A country that **imports more than it exports** (X-M < 0) is said to have a **trade deficit**, which is closer to the **current account deficit** as the current account is mainly made up of imports and exports entry's. For a country with a current account deficit, it **must be balanced by a net surplus** in the **capital and financial accounts**.

When a country consumes more than it produces, the country incurs more debt to foreign entities which are recorded in the financial account.

#### Current account surplus
Conversely, countries with **more exports than imports** (X-M > 0) are said to have a **current account surplus**, a current account surplus is similarly **offset by purchases of foreign physical assets or debt instruments**.

### Relationship with national accounts
For the components of **GDP**, we learned the fundamental relationship between the government deficit, private saving over private investment and the trade surplus.

Rearrange the equation and we get this relationship where the **current account surplus or deficit** is equal to government savings, plus private savings, minus private investments.

The **current account surplus or deficit** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{(X-M)=(T-G)+S-I}$$
where (X-M): current account surplus/deficit (balance of trade); (T-G): government savings; S: private savings; I: private investments.

This relationship tells us that our **current account deficit** is the result of **lower national savings** than **private investments**.

Let's discuss two scenarios that result in current account deficit.

Firstly, it can be due to **very low savings**, which is a result of **high government spending** and **private consumption**. In such a case, **borrowing from foreign countries is used to finance high consumption**. As this does **not increase to the country's future productive power**, it **may have difficulty paying off the debt in the future**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 00.00.30.png]]

In the second scenario, **national savings rate is adequate**, but the **deficit is caused by high private investments**. In such a case, **borrowing from foreign countries is used to invest in domestic capital**, but the debt is less of a concern as the investments may **increase future productive power and eventually produce income to repay the debt**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 00.00.42.png]]

## Trade organisation
### International monetary fund
The main mandate of **international monetary fund (IMF)** is to ensure the **stability** of the **international monetary system**, which is the system of **exchange rates** and **international payments** that enables countries to buy goods and services from each other.

IMF provides:
- international forum for cooperation on international monetary problems
- facilitates the expansion and balanced growth of international trade
- supports exchange rates stability and an open system of international payments
- lends to members experiencing balance of payment difficulties (with adequate safeguards)

One recent example of IMF lending is in the case of the **bailout of Greece**, IMF loans were made available to the Greek government on **strict economic policy conditions**, included:
- wage cuts
- limits on public pensions
- increases in taxes
- a reduction in state owned companies
Through such **conditional emergency lending**, the IMF has helped prevent a contagious wave of sovereign debt crises in global capital markets.

### World bank
The **World Bank**'s main objective is to **help developing countries fight poverty and enhance environmentally sound economic growth**.

For developing countries to grow and attract business:
- strengthen their governments and fight corruption
- implement legal systems that encourage business.
- Protect individual and property rights and honour contracts
- develop robust financial systems to support large scale financing and investments.

**World Bank** provides **projects funding** in developing countries worldwide and **financial** and **technical expertise** aimed at helping those countries reduce poverty.

The World Bank has to closely affiliated entities:
- **the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)**
- **the International Development Association (IDA)**
These are nonprofit financial institutions that provide low or no interest loans and grants to countries that have unfavourable or no access to international credit markets.

### World trade organisation
The **World Trade Organisation (WTO)** is the only international organisation dealing with a **global rules of trade between member nations**. Its main function is to ensure that **trade flows are smoothly, predictably and freely as possible**.

The most important functions of WTO are:
- the implementation, administration, and operation of individual agreements
- acting as a platform for negotiations
- unsettling disputes between members
-  review its members trade policies and ensure the coherence and transparency
- provides training and assistance to developing countries to adjust to WTO rules
- major source of economic research and analysis, reducing ongoing assessments of global trade in its publications and research reports
