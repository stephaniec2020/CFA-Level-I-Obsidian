## Income statement analysis
**Income statement** can provide analyst for **forecasts of future earnings**, and therefore estimates of firm value depend crucially on understanding a firm's income statement, also, it allows evaluation of performance of a company

Income statement allows for calculation of depreciation, COGS, inventory under different cost flow assumptions, as well as basic and diluted EPS. 

Normally, analysts separate **operating** and **non-operating** categories in estimating recurring income, as **operating income** is considered more reliable and representative of a company's **core business operations**. **Non-operating items** are **typically** **excluded** from the calculation of recurring income to provide a clearer picture of the company's ongoing profitability.


## Components and format of an income statement
**Income statement** also known as, **Profit and Loss** statement, Statement of Earnings, Statement of Operations
Income statement explains the net income of the company, and the **net income equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Revenue - Expenses + Other\,Income = Net\,income}$$
where:
- **Revenues** are inflows from delivering or producing goods, rendering services or other activities that constitute the firm's central operations
- **Expenses** are outflows in the process of running these operations, depreciation of assets and incurrence of liabilities that decrease equity
- **Other income** are gains that may or may not arise in the ordinary course of business

### Statement of comprehensive income
**Other comprehensive income** are gains and losses that are excluded from the income statement, so do not confuse with the **other income from the income statement**

Examples of **other comprehensive incomes** are:
- Unrealised gains and losses from investments that are available-for-sale
- Foreign currency exchange gains or losses
- Pension plans gains or losses

The **total comprehensive income** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,Comprehensive\,income =Net\,income + Other\,comprehensive \,income}$$

Firms can choose to report a single total comprehensive income or 2 individual reports of net income and other comprehensive income

> Carpenter Corporation reported the following statement of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2006:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Common stock at par|$600,000|
|Additional paid-in-capital|900,000|
|Treasury stock|(200,000)|
|Retained earnings|10,500,000|
|Accumulated other comprehensive income|450,000|
||$12,250,000|

> During 2007, Carpenter:
> - earned net income of $1,700,000.
> - declared dividends of $300,000. $75,000 of the dividends remain unpaid.
> - purchased held-to-maturity securities for $100,000. The securities have a fair value of $110,000 at year-end.
> - purchased **available-for-sale** securities for $250,000. The securities have a fair value of $225,000 at year-end.
> - translated the **financial statements of a foreign subsidiary** and calculated a $90,000 unrealised gain.
> - purchased treasury stock for $75,000. The stock was valued at $60,000 when issued.
> 
> Calculate Carpenter's accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2007.As of December 31, 2007, Carpenter's accumulated other comprehensive income is **$515,000** $450,000 beginning balance â€“ $25,000 unrealised loss from available for sale securities ($225,000 fair value â€“ $250,000 cost) + $90,000 unrealised translation gain. There is no impact on accumulated other comprehensive income from unrealised gains and losses on held-to-maturity securities since the securities are not reported at fair value on the balance sheet. The purchase of treasury stock does not affect comprehensive income because it is a transaction with shareholders.

## Reasons of analysing income statement
There are 2 major types of population who are interested in analysing income statement:
- **Investor** - valuation and investment purposes
- **Creditors/lenders** - whether the company is able to fulfil its debt obligation

## What is included in the income statement?
### Core Operations
#### Revenue
- **Revenue** refers to the amounts reported from the sales of goods and services in the normal course of business
$$\mathrm{Net\,revenue = Revenue - Adjustments}$$
- what are adjustments?

#### Expense
**Expenses** are the amount incurred to generate revenue. **Expenses** on the **income statement** are grouped by the nature of expense items or by their function.

Here are some of the examples of expenses:
- Cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Operating expenses (e.g. bad debt expense)
- Depreciation
- Interest paid
- Tax

#### Other Income/expenses
- Non-core operations (e.g. Unused warehouse - for renting purposes)
- Investment/Asset sale

## Formula for net income
The full formula for the **net income** is:
$$\mathrm{Net\,income = R-E+OI-OE+G-L-MI}$$
where R: Revenue; E: Expenses; OI: Other Income; OE: Other Expenses; G: Gain; L:Loss; MI: Minority Interest

where:
- **Subsidiary net income** - full net income subsidiary is reported in parent's income sheet
In cases where there are minority shareholders in the subsidiary, this portion of the net income should not be attributed to the parent.
- **Minority Interest** - the proportion of the subsidiary's income now owned interest by the parent is reported in the parent's income statement as **non controlling interest/minority interest**
- Therefore, the minority interest is subtracted from the consolidated total income from the parent income statement to get the net income of the parent company.
- e.g. Company BIG owns 70% of company SMALL. Company SMALL had a net income of $10,000 last year. The full $10,000 income from SMALL is reported in BIGâ€™s income statement. BIG only owns 70% of SMALL. 30% of the $10,000 should be attributed to minority shareholders of SMALL. So, the answer is $3,000.

Therefore, BIG should report a minority interest of $3,000. Â This is subtracted from BIGâ€™s income.

> Galaxy Corporation manufactures custom motorcycles. Galaxy finances the motorcycles over 36 months for customers who make a minimum down payment of 10%. Historically, Galaxy has experienced bad debt losses equal to 1% of sales. Galaxy also provides a 24 month unlimited warranty on all new motorcycles. In the past, warranty expense has averaged 3% of sales. Ignoring taxes, how does the recognition of bad debt expense and warranty expense at the time of sale affect Galaxy's liabilities?
> 
> Bad debt expense: No effect
> Warranty expense: Increase
> 
> The recognition of bad debt expense has no effect on liabilities, current revenues are reduced by the expected amount of uncollectable accounts. Bad debt expense reduces net income and reduces assets. The recognition of expected warranty expense decreases net income (following the matching principle), and since it is not currently paid (doesn't reduce assets) it creates or increases a liability at the time of sale.

## Presentation formats
There are 2 types of presentation format:
- Single-step income statement
- Multi-step income statement90

### Single-step income statement
- Revenues and gains are grouped together
- Expenses and losses are grouped together

![[Screenshot 2022-10-18 at 16.17.58.png]]

### Multi-step income statement
- Multi-step income statement includes gross profit, revenues minus cost of goods sold (COGS)
- **Gross profit** is the amount that remains after the direct cost of producing a product or service are subtracted from revenue 
- **Operating profit** is the amount after subtracting the operating expenses, such as, selling, general, and administrative expenses, from gross profit results in another subtotal (i.e. EBIT)
- **EBITA** - earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (interest expense) is usually considered an operating expense for financial firms, EBITA can often be used as a proxy for operating income in analysis

## Revenue recognition on income statement
### General Principles
**Accrual Accounting** - revenue is recorded when the firm earns it regardless of whether cash is paid. The firm can provide the goods or services receive the cash payment. The income is recorded in the retain earnings of the income statement. Firms can manipulate earnings by recognising revenue earlier or later using accrual methods.

#### If the customer decided to pay later (credit):
- If the sale of goods is made on credit, the revenue is recognised at the time of sale, an asset, account receivable is created on the balance sheet
- The retained earning and accounts receivables (income statement) increased

**_Trade receivables_Â are defined as the amount owed to a business by its customers following the sale of goods or services on credit OR ANOTHER DEFINITION: selling to customers on credit will generate accounts receivable for a business.**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 12.29.14.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 12.29.24.png]]
eg. Buy-Now-Pay-Later Schemes, that the company can put that as increased retained earnings.


#### If the customer decided to pay cash first:
- If payments for the goods is received prior to the transfer of the goods, (i.e. received cash but have not provided the service)
- **Unearned revenue** refers to the funds a company receives from customers for goods or services that have not yet been provided. 
- The increase in cash and **unearned revenue** (therefore it is a liability, e.g. magazine subscription) in the balance sheet
- The revenue is not recorded in the income statement at the time of the buyer paid cash.
- **Once the good has been delivered, the revenue is recorded in the income sheet and the liabilities have been deceased (unearned revenue)**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 12.30.28.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 12.34.36.png]]

Since the service has not been fulfilled, the cash should not be recorded as revenue yet. The cash should go into cash account (asset) in the balance sheet. An equivalent unearned revenue (liability) should also be recorded in the balance sheet.

### Accounting standards for revenue recognition
IASB and FASB converged new standards for **revenue recognition** in 2018, the standard took a principal-based approach in recognition issues.

There are 2 requirements to fulfil in order for revenue recognition:
- Seller should **recognise revenue if the good/service has been transferred to the customer** (consistent with the accrual accounting principle).
- Completion of earning process (be it through credit or cash)

There are 5 steps of **revenue recognition**:
1. Identify contract(s) with a customer
2. Identify distinct performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognise revenue when performance obligation is satisfied

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 12.44.56.png]]

### 1. Identify contract(s) with a customer
The first step is to identify and determine the existence of a contract between the company and its customer. A **contract** is an "agreement that creates enforceable **rights and obligations** between **2 or more parties** and typically includes the exchange of goods, services, or non-financial assets".

Contract exists only if collectability is *probable* (probable is defined differently under IFRS or US GAAP; IFRS: more likely than not; US GAAP: more likely to occur).

### 2. Identify distinct performance obligations in the contract
Once a contract is identified, the next step is to identify the individual **performance obligations** within that contract. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a **distinct** good or service to the customer. Each distinct performance obligation is accounted for separately.

**Distinct** good or service is one that meets **both** of the criteria:
- Customer can benefit from it on its own or in combination with readily available resources
- It can be separated from other obligations in the contract as different items are accounted separately in the contract

### 3. Determine transaction price
The **transaction price** is the amount of consideration the company **expects to receive** in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The transaction price **may be fixed or variable** and may include discounts, rebates, or other considerations. 

- A firm should only recognise revenue when its that they will not have to return or refund it.

### 4. Allocate transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
The transaction price determined in step 3 is allocated to each distinct performance obligation in proportion to their relative standalone selling prices. If the standalone selling price of a performance obligation is not directly observable, estimation techniques may be used.

### 5. Recognise revenue when performance obligation is satisfied
**Revenue is recognized** when a **performance obligation is satisfied**, which occurs when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. This can happen over time, as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the goods or services, or at a point in time, when control is transferred.

Summarised into 3 points:
- **Recognise revenue** when **performance obligation is satisfied/delivered**
- **Highly probable** that the **sale will not be reversed**
- If there's a possibility in **refund obligation**, it is **recognised as a liability** - it is fine to fully recognise the revenue. 

**Note:** Seller should recognise revenue only if the performance obligation is fully satisfied. If there are **outstanding issues, the seller should not have fully recognised all the revenue.** Refund obligations require the seller to recognise a liability to account for the likelihood of a refund. It is fine to fully recognise the revenue. Under accrual accounting rules, revenue can be recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, even if the customer has not yet paid.

Revenue, COGS, and full warranty expense should be recognised in the period the inventory was sold.

### Revenue recognition for long-term contract
For **long-term contract**, **revenue is recognised** based on the **progress toward completion** of a performance obligation (good/services)

#### Progress toward completion measured through input side
- **Progress toward completion** - It uses % of completion cost by the seller 
- **Performance obligation** uses % of transaction value recognised as revenue
- It was the ("percentage-of-completion") method under previous accounting standards

#### Progress toward completion measured through output side
- Engineering milestones or % of output delivered

### Example of revenue recognition 
![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 13.19.19.png]]


#### Contract modification
- **New contract** - change involve goods/services that are distinct from the goods/services already transferred, otherwise modification of existing contract

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 13.27.47.png]]

#### Capitalised cost
- **Capitalised cost** - the costs to secure the contract, such as sales commissions
- It is **not** recognised in the income statement
- It should be placed in the balance sheet under assets (capitalised costs)

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 13.29.58.png]]

### Recognition of revenue by an agent
Definition of an **agent** is as follows:
- Not primarily responsible for fulfilling contract
- Does not take inventory risk or credit risk
- Does not have discretion in setting price
- Receives compensation in the form of a commission
- The **commission** should only be recognised as revenue

![[Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 13.33.58.png]]

### Disclosure requirements of income statement
- The information about contracts with customers (by **category**)
- Contract-related **assets** and **liabilities** (include balances and changes)
- Remaining performance **obligation** and transaction **prices**
- Significant **judgements** and changes in judgments used to determine the **amount** and **timing** of **revenue recognition**

## Inventory expense recognition
### General principles of expense recognition
- **Accrual Accounting** - revenue is recorded when the firm earns it regardless of whether cash is paid. The firm can provide the goods or services receive the cash payment. The income is recorded in the retain earnings of the income statement.
- **Matching principle** - expenses are recognised in the same period as the revenue
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) - 
-

### Inventory expense recognition
In a case where there are old inventory and new inventory acquired at different prices, there are 4 methods to calculate the **inventory expenses**:
- Serial number (special identification)
- First in first out (FIFO)
- Last in first out (LIFO)
- Weight average cost

The **inventory expense** formula is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,COGS = COGS+ Ending\,inventory}$$
where COGS: Cost of goods sold.

The expense (COGS) is recognised at the time when the inventory sold, and also when the revenue is recognised. Bad debt and warranty expense at the period when the inventory is sold.

#### Serial number (special identification)
- Each of the inventory have its own special identification
- The inventory sold corresponds to each item, therefore the inventory expensed is known
- It is only appropriate for businesses that deals with a small number of costly and easily identifiable products.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.44.17.png]]

#### First in first out (FIFO)
- Deplete the earlier inventory first
- Based on most recent purchases â‡’ best reflection of current cost
- It is accepted by both IFRS and US GAAP

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.49.26.png]]

#### Last in first out  (LIFO)
- Under LIFO, the units purchased first will form the ending inventory.
- LIFO is prohibited in IFRS accounting standard, but accepted in US GAAP

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.59.09.png]]

#### Weighted average cost
- It is the most simplest objective method of calculating the average cost of the goods.

The equation of **weighted average unit cost** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Average\,unit\,cost = \frac{Total\,inventory\,cost}{Number\,of\,products}}$$
During inflationary and deflationary period, the COGS using the weighted average cost will be between the FIFO method and LIFO method.

## Implications of financial analysis on income statement
### Inventory expense recognition
- The expense of bad debt - estimate of the credit of sales that will not be realised in the future
- The expense of warranty - estimate of sales revenue lost to provide warranty service in the future

## Depreciation and Amortisation Expense Recognition
### Realisation 
- Expense (COGS) are realised at the time of when the inventory is sold ("matching principle")
- However, not all costs can be realised at the time of the delivery of the goods/services, also known as period cost, e.g. rent incurred and administrative cost.

### Depreciation and Amortisation
- Asset Acquired 
- Future economic benefits, revenue, 
- **Depreciation** is for tangible assets
- **Amortisation** is for intangible assets
- **Depreciation and amortisation** is the allocation of cost over asset's useful life

![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.06.22.png]]

### Modelling for depreciation or amortisation of PP&E for each period
**Depreciation** is the allocation of cost over an asset's useful life. The original purchase price of the asset is also known as **historical cost**, which includes the **installation** and **transportation cost.**

Historical cost - accumulated depreciation = the book value of the asset (a.k.a carrying value, it is the net value of asset on the balance sheet); accumulated depreciation is the real and significant operating expense.

There are **3 different models for depreciation and amortisation**:
- Straight line method
- Accelerated depreciation method - e.g. (Double-decline doubling method)
- Units production method

#### Straight line method
- Straight line of depreciation + residual value that can be sold for at the end of its life
- the economic benefits of its useful life depreciated equally every year
- **assumption**: equal depreciation each year

The **straight-line method equation** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Straight\,line\,depreciation\,method = \frac{Cost-Residual\,value}{Useful\,life}}$$
![[Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12.47.11.png]]

#### Accelerated depreciation method
By using the accelerated depreciation method (e.g. double declining balance method),
- **assumption**: generate more benefits in the early years of their economic life; recognises more depreciation expenses in the early years; the depreciation would be the same as straight line method
- e.g. Factory machines working at its 100% efficiency and depreciate in logarithmically/exponential decay (yet to be determined)

The **double declining balance method (DDB)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DDB\,Depreciation = \frac {2}{Useful\,life} \times (Cost-Accumulated\,depreciation)}$$ where $\mathrm{Cost - Accumulated\,depreciation}$ is also known as the **net book value**, and depreciation stops when net book value reaches residual value.

![[Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 13.32.21.png]]

#### Units-of-production method
The units of production method:
- is primarily used to calculate depreciation for assets that are based on their usage or production output. 
- allocates the asset's cost over its estimated total production or usage units. 

The **units-of-production method** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Units\,of\,production \,depreciation=\frac{Output\,units}{Total\,capacity\,in\,units}\times(Cost-Residual\,value)}$$

### Amortisation
**Amortisation** refers to the systematic allocation or spreading out of the cost of an intangible asset or a long-term liability over a specific period. It is a method used in accounting to recognise the consumption or expiration of the asset's value or the reduction of the liability over time.

There are different amortisation method according to the type of asset:
- **Intangible asset with finite life** - straight line method is used (e.g. franchising contract, copyright)
- **Intangible assets with indefinite life** - is not amortised (e.g. goodwill, associated with the purchase of one company by another. It represents value that can give the acquiring company a competitive advantage.), but tested annually for impairment. If impaired an expense equal to the impairment amount is recognised.

## Non-recurring and non-operating items
Since **income statement** is for **future projection of how the company's performance**, it is important that the income statement separates the non-recurring and non-operating items

There are 2 ways in separating the income statement:
- Recurring and non-recurring items
- Operating and non-operating items

## Recurring and non-recurring items
**Income statement** provides an estimate of the company's financial performance and projection in the future's earning potential, therefore it is crucial to identify the items that are going to be consistently used in the future or not.

### Recurring items
**Recurring items** are regular and predictable components of a company's income statement that are expected to continue in the future
- e.g. sale of goods or services, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and interest income or expense from regular business activities.

### Non-recurring items
**Non-recurring items** are income or expense items that are unusual, infrequent, or non-predictable in nature. Notes for accounting changes and explanation of each item in the following section.

It can be subdivided into:
- **unusual/infrequent items**
- **discontinued operation** 
- **extraordinary items**

#### Unusual or infrequent items
**Unusual or infrequent item** is unusual in nature ***or*** infrequent in occurrence, **but not both**, income or expense items that are not expected to occur regularly in the company's operations.
- e.g. gains/losses from a disposal of business segment, gains/losses from asset sale, provisions for environmental remediation, impairments, write-offs, write-downs, restructuring costs, integration expense associated with business recently acquired
- Reported **before** tax, as part of income from continuous operations

#### Discontinued operations
**Discontinued operations** if the management has **decided to dispose of or planned sale**, but not completed yet.

The discontinued operations:
- **Physically/operationally** distinct from the rest of the firm
- Reported **net of tax**, after income from continuous operations
- **Analyst implication:** elimination such items in forming future earning expectation

#### Extraordinary items
**Extraordinary items** are **both** unusual and infrequent significant events or transactions that are both unusual in nature and occur infrequently. 
- e.g. Losses from an expropriation of assets, natural disasters,  expropriations, or major legal settlements
- Reported **net of tax**, after income from continuous operations
- **Prohibited** under IFRS. After Dec 2015, prohibited under US GAAP

## Accounting changes
Also, accounting changes can lead to differences to compare from one period's statement to another, 3 of the accounting changes are listed as follows:
- Changes in accounting principle
- Changes in accounting estimates
- Prior period adjustments

#### Changes in accounting principles
- e.g. change in inventory accounting from LIFO to FIFO
- Requires retrospective application (i.e. all of the prior-period financial statements currently presented are restated)

#### Changes in accounting estimates
- changes in management's judgement
- e.g. change in residual value of a long-lived asset
- applied prospectively (i.e. applied to the financial statements for the current and future periods)

#### Prior period adjustments
- Correction of an error for a prior period
- Restate the financial statements for all prior periods presented in the current financial statements
- Need to disclose nature of adjustment and its effect on net income

![[Screenshot 2022-10-25 at 15.31.23.png]]

## Operating and Non-operating items
### Operating items
- Activities involving **producing and delivering goods**
- Activities involving the **provision of service**
- Include all transactions that are **not investing or financing activities**

### Non-operating items
- Non-financial company invests in **equity** or **debt securities** issued by another company
- **Interest, dividends** or **profits from sales** of these securities will be shown as non-operating income
- **Interest expense** is a recurring cost. For non-financial companies, non-operating items is a financing cost, which is included in **interest expense**. It is excluded from operating expenses.
- **Note**: For financial service companies, interest income and expenses are likely components of operating activities

The **operating profit equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Operating\,profit = Revenue-COGS-Depreciation\,expense}$$
**Note:** Interest and tax expenses are not operating items.

## Basic earnings per share
**Earnings per share (EPS)** is one of the most commonly used corporate profitability performance for publicly traded firms. Non-publicly traded firms are not required to report EPS data.

It is required both under **IFRS** and **US GAAP** to disclose earnings per share.

EPS is only reported for shares of common stock (also know as ordinary stock)
- **Common stock**: Most shares tend to be common stock carrying one vote each and with an equal right to a proportionate share of dividends. Common stock dividends tend to rise as profits grow. This is in contrast to preferred stock where the dividend tends to be fixed.

All firms with **complex capital structures** must report both **basic** and **diluted EPS**; whereas firms with **simple capital structure** report only **basic EPS**.

#### Company types
**Company** may have either a **simple** or **complex** capital structure:
- **Simple capital structure**: no potentially dilutive securities; it only contains common stock, non-convertible debt, and non-convertible preferred stock
- **Complex capital structure**: contains potentially dilutive securities 
	- **Potential dilutive securities** are financial instruments that are potentially convertible to common stock such as options (e.g. employee stock option), convertible bonds, convertible preferred stocks, warrants or any other convertible securities
**Capital Structure:** the amount of debt and/or equity employed by a firm to fund its operations and finance its assets. In order to optimise the structure, a firm will decide if it needs more debt or equity and can issue whichever it requires.

![[Screenshot 2023-01-31 at 00.29.21.png]]
**Preferred stock**: Preferred stock has preferential rights over common stock to both dividends and also to assets in the event that a company is wound up (i.e. preferred stock holders are paid out before common stock holders). Typically preferred stock dividends are fixed (e.g. 6 percent preferred stock) and do not increase with rising profits.

### Formula for calculating earnings per share
Since **Earnings per share** is the per-share earnings available to common shareholders, the adjusted earnings are available to shareholder over number of outstanding common shares is needed to calculate EPS.

**Preferred dividends** differs from the common stock dividends, preferred shareholder are entitled to a fixed dividends, which is not available for the common stock shareholders

#### Basic earnings per share
**Basic EPS** for common stockholders equation is as follows:

$$\mathrm{Basic\,EPS = \frac{Net\,Income - Preferred \,dividends}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
where the **Preferred dividends**: the dividends for preferred shareholder, and **weighted average number of common shares outstanding (WANCSO)**: the number of shares times the weight of the months of the common stock have been for.

$$\mathrm{WANSCO = Common\,shares \times \frac{Months\,holding}{12}}$$
where **months holding:** the months of holding common stock till the end of the statement period; where 1st of month require (12-month+1)/12 and 31st of month only (12-month)/12.

> A firm has had the following numbers of shares outstanding during the year:
> 
> Beginning of year	10,000,000 shares
> Issued on April 1	500,000 shares
> Split 2 for 1 on July 1	
> Issued on October 1	100,000 shares
> Split 2 for 1 on December 31	
> Based on this information, what is the weighted number of shares outstanding for the year? 
>

#### Corporate actions that can affect the number of outstanding shares
There are 4 ways that can affect the number of outstanding shares:
- New issue
- Repurchase
- Stock split
- Stock dividend

##### Stock split
- The division of each old share into a specific number of new post-split shares
- e.g. 2-for-1 split: 100 shares (original) â‡’ 200 shares (new)
- e.g. 3-for-2 split: 100 shares (original) â‡’ 150 shares (new)

##### Stock dividend
- The distribution of additional shares to each shareholder in an amount proportional to their current number of shares
- 5% stock div: 100 shares (original) â‡’ 105 shares (new)
The **January 1 balance is adjusted retroactively for the stock dividend**.
The proportion of the ownership remains unchanged â‡’ not dilutive or anti-dilutive

>An analyst gathered the following information about a company:
>- 01/01/04 - 50,000 shares issued and outstanding at the beginning of the year
>- 04/01/04 - 5% stock dividend
>- 10/01/04 - 10% stock dividend
>
>What is the company's weighted average number of shares outstanding at the end of 2004?
>
>The weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the number of shares outstanding during the year weighted by the portion of the year they were outstanding. Dividends and splits are applied to all shares issued or repurchased and all original or adjusted shares outstanding prior to the split or dividend.
>
>Step 1) Apply the 04/01/04 dividend to the beginning-of-year shares: Adjusted shares = 1.05 Ã— 50,000 = 52,500
>
>Step 2) Apply the 10/01/04 dividend the adjusted beginning-of-year shares. Adjusted beginning of year shares = 57,750 (= 1.1 Ã— 52,500).
>
>Step 3) Compute the weighted average number of shares. 57,750 Ã— (12/12) = 57,750 shares.



## Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS)
**EPS** can potentially be diluted (i.e. **diluted EPS**) if the capital structure contain:
- Convertible preferred shares
- Convertible bonds
- Stock options
- Warrants

### Diluted earnings per share and Convertible preferred shares
There are 2 types of preferred shares: 
- **Convertible preferred shares**
- **Non-convertible shares**

- "If-converted" method: Calculates what effect would have been if the convertible preferred shares converted at the **beginning of the period**
- If converted, the convertible preferred shares would be outstanding common stocks

![[Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 11.33.25.png]]

$$\mathrm{Diluted\,EPS = \frac{Net\,Income - Preferred \,dividends+Convertible\,preferred\,dividends}{WANCSO+Shares\,from\,converted\,preferred\,shares}}$$

### Diluted earnings per share and convertible bonds
For companies with complex capital structure is as follows: 
- Common stock
- **Convertible bonds** - which normally pays out interest
- Non-convertible preferred shares

- "If-converted" method: Calculates what effect would have been if the convertible bonds  converted at the **beginning of the period**
- **Note:** Debt interest is often non-taxable

![[Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 11.53.27.png]]

$$\mathrm{D\,EPS = \frac{Net\,Income - Pref. \,dividends+Convertible\,bonds\,interest \times(1-T)}{WANCSO+Shares\,from\,converted\,bonds}}$$

#### Diluted earnings per share and Stock Options/Warrants
The options/warrants should be calculated "as-if" (**treasury stock** method):
1. Assume that all options are exercised, creating X number of new shares 
   (i.e. $\mathrm{\$\,amount\,of\,all\,option\,exercised=Option\,exericse\,price \times \#\,of\,Options}$)
2. Use cash proceeds used to repurchase Y number of shares - using the **average traded price** of the shares of the year
   (i.e. $\mathrm{\#\,shares\,repurchased=\$\,amount\,of\,all\,option\,exercised/ Avg.\,traded\,share\,price}$)
3. The net increase due to exercised options is as follows:
   (i.e. $\mathrm{Net\,increase\,\#\,of\,shares=\#\,shares\,repurchased-\#\,of\,options}$)

### Logic for inclusion in computation of diluted EPS
- Examine each security to determine if it is dilutive, include in computation only if it is dilutive
- **Diluted EPS < Basic EPS â‡’ Security is dilutive â‡’ Include in computation**
- Diluted EPS > Basic EPS â‡’ Security is anti-dilutive â‡’ exclude from computation

Quick check whether **convertible preferred shares** are dilutive:
$$\mathrm{\frac{Preferred\,dividend}{Num\,shares\,created} < Basic\, EPS}$$
If so, it is dilutive.

Quick check whether **convertible bonds** are dilutive:
$$\mathrm{\frac{Interest \times (1-T)}{Num\,shares\,created} < Basic\, EPS}$$
If so, it is dilutive.

Quick check whether **convertible bonds** are dilutive:
$$\mathrm{Exercise\,price < Average\,market\,price\,of\,the\,stock}$$
If so, it is dilutive.

### The significance of earnings per share

## Common-size and Ratio Analysis
There are 3 ways to calculate the **margin ratio** and compare between companies of different sizes:
- **Gross profit margin**
- **Operating profit margin**
- **Net profit margin (also known as net margin)**

### Gross profit margin
**Gross profit margin** calculates the **profitability of a company's core operations** by measuring the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS), the **gross profit margin** equation is as follows:

$$\mathrm{Gross\,profit\,margin = \frac{Gross\,profit}{Revenue}}$$
where: gross profit: revenue - COGS
The **gross profit margin** can be increased by raising prices or reducing production cost
- **Note:** Increase in number of units sold will not affect gross profit margin, if the margin per unit remains the same. A decrease in cost per unit will increase the gross profit margin.

### Operating profit margin
The **operating profit margin** assesses the profitability of a company's core operations, taking into account both the direct costs of producing goods or services (COGS) and the indirect operating expenses such as selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). The  **operating profit margin** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Operating\,profit\,margin = \frac{Operating\,profit}{Revenue}=\frac{EBIT}{Net\,sales}}$$

where operating profit: revenue - COGS - SG&A.

### Net profit margin
The **net profit margin** evaluates the overall profitability of the company after considering all expenses, including operating expenses, interest expenses, taxes, and non-operating items. The equation for **net profit margin** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = \frac{Net\,profit}{Revenue}}$$
where the net profit is the profit after all expenses (EBITDA).

### Common-size statement
**Common-size statement** is a statement where all of the information can also be presented in percentages, it can provide an understanding of the firm's strategy.

There are two types of common-size statement:
- **Cross-sectional analysis** - compare ratios across companies
- **Time-series analysis** - compare the company's performance over time, understand whether this can be sustained into future periods

Example of a common-size statement:
![[Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 12.23.36.png]]
- Normally it is comparable between two companies using the common-size statement, except for taxes.
- Effective tax rate is important to compare between two companies

$$\mathrm{Effective\,tax\,rate = \frac{Tax\,expense}{Pre\,tax\,income}}$$

## Other Comprehensive income (OCI)
Items that can be considered as other comprehensive income:
- Foreign currency translation gains and losses
- Adjustments for minimum pension liability
- **Unrealised gains and losses from cash flow hedging derivatives**
- Unrealised gains and losses from available-for-sale-securities

#### Available-for-sale securities
- Securities that are not expected to be held to maturity or sold in the near term
- They are reported on the balance sheet at fair value
- Unrealised gains and losses in income statement, but OCI
- **Part of shareholder's equity (under other comprehensive income)**
- Classification is not allowed from 2018 - however, allowed financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

> At the beginning of the year, Alpha Corporation, which reports under U.S. GAAP, purchased bonds with a market value of $200,000. During the year, these bonds paid $2,000 cash interest. At the end of the year, the bonds had a market value of $220,000. What amount should Alpha recognize in its year-end income statement if the investment is treated as an available-for-sale security and what amount should be recognized in the income statement if the investment is treated as a trading security? Available-for-sale: $2000; Trading security: $22,000
> 
> Unrealised gains and losses from trading securities are recognized in the income statement while unrealised gains and losses from available-for-sale securities bypass the income statement and are reported as other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Cash interest is recognized in the income statement for both trading and available-for-sale securities. Thus, Alpha will recognise only the $2,000 interest if the bonds are considered available-for-sale and will recognise $22,000 ($2,000 interest + $20,000 unrealised gain) if the bonds are considered trading securities.

### Accounting Equation
$$\mathrm{Assets = Liabilities +Contributed\,capital+Retained\,earnings}$$
where **retained earnings** equation is:
$$\mathrm{Retained\,earnings = Beginning\,retained\,earnings+Net\,income-Dividend}$$
However, this is not always the case since there's other comprehensive income.

### Other comprehensive income (OCI)
The other comprehensive income (OCI) equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Change\,in\,retained\,earnings\, for\,period = Net\,income-Div.+OCI}$$
where Div.: dividends; OCI: Other comprehensive income
