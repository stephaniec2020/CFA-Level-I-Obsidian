## Inventory equation
There are differences in recording the inventories accounts depending on the industry of the firms: **merchandising firm** vs. **manufacturing firms**.

### Merchandising firm
**Merchandising firm** record inventory in **1 single account** as inventory.
The **inventory equation of merchandising firms** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Ending\,inventory = Beginning\,inventory+Purchased\,inventory-COGS}$$
and this equation can be rearranged in any ways to find out the unknown value.

### Manufacturing firm
**Manufacturing firm** have 3 accounts to marked down as inventory. 
The inventory accounts are as follows:
- Raw materials
- Work-in-process
- Finished goods

## Inventory costs
Both IFRS and US GAAP have clear guidelines on which should be considered as:
- **inventory cost** to **capitalise** in **balance sheet** 
- **operating expense** and **expensed** in **income statement**

**Product costs** (**capitalise**) would be considered as **assets** (inventory section) in the balance sheet:
- **Purchase cost** - less trade discounts and rebates
- **Conversion cost** - or manufacturing costs including labour and overhead
- **Delivery cost** - and other costs to bring the inventory to its location (**only costs incurred to bring the inventory in place can be capitalised**; **delivery costs to customer should be expensed**)

**Period costs** (**expenses**) would be considered as **operating expenses** in the income statement:
- **Abnormal waste** of materials, labour or overhead
- **Storage costs**
- **Admin overhead**
- **Selling costs**

## Inventory adjustments (revaluation)
Both IFRS and US GAAP allow for the revaluation of the inventory value.

### IFRS guideline on inventory adjustments
Under **IFRS**:
- Inventory value is reported **at the lower** of **cost** or **net realisable value (NRV)**
**Net realisable value (NRV)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{NRV = Estimated\,selling\,price - Cost\,of\,completion - Selling\,cost}$$
If the NRV is lower than the cost, then under IFRS, the **balance sheet has the NRV written in the inventory** and the **write off** under COGS is in the **income statement**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.17.02.png]]

The **write off can be reversed** in **IFRS** if the estimated selling price is once again above the cost. 
Then the situation will be as follows:
- **revalued at cost price** in the **balance sheet** inventory section
- **reversal of the amount** **previously deducted from income sheet** in the COGS section

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.19.11.png]]

### US GAAP guideline on inventory adjustments
Under **US GAAP**:
- Inventory value is reported at the lower of **cost** or **market**
- **Market value** is determined as the **replacement cost** of the inventory, **but it is limited within the range of net realisable value (NRV) minus a normal profit margin**.

**Market value** is determined by the 3 situations:
- If the **replacement cost < NRV**, market value = NRV - normal profit margin.
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.22.54.png]]
- If **replacement cost > NRV**, then market value = NRV.
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.23.06.png]]
- If **replacement cost < lower bound of NRV- normal profit margin**, then the market value is the NRV-profit margin 

If the **market value < cost**, then the **market value is written down in the inventory o**f the **balance sheet**; and the **write-off** will be written down as loss under **COGS section of income statement**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.23.18.png]]

Unlike **IFRS**, **reversal** is not allowed under **US GAAP**.

Under **US GAAP**, the same situation of the car will be sold which is below the cost, the market price = replacement cost as it is not below the normal profit margin. The inventory has market value = replacement cost, and the write off in the COGS section of income statement.

>Victor Electronics, a manufacturer of electronic components, reports inventory using the FIFO costing method. In the prior period, Victor wrote its inventory down from cost of $2 million to its net realisable value of $1 million. During the current period, net realisable value increased to $4 million because of a shortage of computer chips. For the current period, Victor would most appropriately report an inventory value of: **$2 million under IFRS and $1 million under U.S. GAAP.**
>
>Under IFRS, a firm that has written down inventory to net realisable value may record any subsequent reversal (limited to the original writedown amount) as a gain on the income statement. Under U.S. GAAP, reversals of inventory writedowns are not permitted.

>A company purchased inventory on January 1, 20X2, for $600,000. On December 31, 20X2, the inventory had a net realizable value (NRV) of $550,000 and a replacement cost of $525,000, which is also the NRV less the normal profit margin. What would be the carrying value of the inventory on the company's December 31, 20X2, balance sheet using: 
>**Lower of cost or NRV? $550,000;	Lower of cost or market? $525,000**
>Lower of cost or NRV is $550,000. Using lower of cost or market, the replacement cost of $525,000 would be used because it is below NRV and equal to the NRV less the normal profit margin.

## Effects of inventory write-downs
There are effects of inventory write-downs on inventory section of the balance sheet (NRV under IFRS and market value under US GAAP; and both are under current assets) and the write-off under the COGS section in income statement. 

The **write-down effects of inventory** are as follows:
- **Current ratio** - decreases as current assets decrease, **quick ratio and cash ratio are unaffected** since inventories are not included in the numerator
- **Inventory turnover** - **increases** as the COGS increases and average inventory decreases
- **Days of inventory on hand** and **cash conversion cycle** decrease.
- **Total asset turnover** - **increases** due to the decrease in total assets.
- **Debt-to-assets ratio** - **increases** due to the reduction in average total assets.
- **Debt to equity ratio** increases due to the decrease in total equity.
- **Gross margin**, **operating margin**, and **net margin** - decrease due to the decrease in profits.
- **Net income** - may increase in subsequent periods if COGS is decreased by lower inventory carrying values. This increase in net income will increase reported ROA and ROE in subsequent periods, together with the decreases in assets and equity from the prior period write-down.

### Cost flow methods

The **inventory equation of merchandising firms** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Ending\,inventory = Beginning\,inventory+Purchased\,inventory-COGS}$$
COGS: Cost of goods sold.

The **equation of COGS** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{COGS = \#\,of\,units\,sold \times Unit\,cost}$$
Since the units are sold in different time periods, and the acquiring costs of each inventory differs by the time of acquiring the inventory, there are several ways to calculate the unit cost (**Cost flow method**).

There are 4 cost flow methods:
- Specific identification
- FIFO
- LIFO
- Weighted average cost

#### Serial number (special identification)
- Each of the inventory have its own special identification
- The inventory sold corresponds to each item, therefore the inventory expensed is known
- It is only appropriate for businesses that deals with a small number of costly and easily identifiable products.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.44.17.png]]

#### First in first out (FIFO)
- Deplete the earlier inventory first
- Based on most recent purchases â‡’ best reflection of current cost
- It is accepted by both IFRS and US GAAP
- Under **FIFO**, since it is based on earliest costs, due to inflationary environment, the **COGS are understated** and the **earnings are overstated**.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 16.49.26.png]]

#### Last in first out  (LIFO)
- Under LIFO, the units purchased first will form the ending inventory.
- **LIFO is prohibited in IFRS** accounting standard, but accepted in US GAAP
- In an inflationary environment, LIFO COGS > FIFO COGS, therefore LIFO as inventory accounting method will have **lower earnings thus lower taxes**, making it favourable under US firms to use this method to defer taxes. (LIFO -> higher COGS -> lower pre-tax profit; FIFO -> lower COGS -> higher taxable income. Since more tax is paid, a deferred tax asset is more likely.)
- i.e. in an inflationary environment, LIFO results in higher COGS, lower inventory value, and lower gross profit compared to FIFO.
- LIFO results in cost of sales that are nearer to current costs compared to other inventory cost methods, and inventory values based on outdated prices (below replacement cost if prices are increasing, above replacement cost if prices are decreasing).
- The LIFO conformity rule in the U.S. requires firms to use LIFO for their financial statements if they use LIFO for income tax purposes.

> Cushinson uses the LIFO method of determining cost of goods sold. First year sales were 1,300 units. The most likely effects of using LIFO inventory costing as compared to FIFO in Cushinson's 20X6 financial statements are:
> 
> The first step is to determine the direction of prices:
> Purchase	Total Cost	Units	Per-unit Cost
> 1/1/X6	$9,500	Ã· 250	= $38
> 3/1/X6	$14,800	Ã· 400	= $37
> 7/1/X6	$14,850	Ã· 450	= $33
> 9/1/X6	$15,950	Ã· 550	= $29
> LIFO assumes cost of goods sold (COGS) includes recent purchases and ending inventory contains the oldest purchases.
> 
> Notice that per-unit prices are falling. Under falling prices, LIFO inventory costing will result in higher net income because the recent units were cheaper than the older purchases (and beginning inventory), making the cost of goods sold lower and net income higher. Working capital will be higher because LIFO inventory is greater than FIFO inventory when prices are falling.

#### Weighted average cost
- It is the most simplest objective method of calculating the average cost of the goods.
- The equation of average unit cost is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Average\,unit\,cost = \frac{Total\,inventory\,cost}{Number\,of\,products}}$$
- During inflationary and deflationary period, the COGS using the weighted average cost will be between the FIFO method and LIFO method.

### To tackle the question for inventory calculation
1. Calculate the total inventory cost capitalised: $\mathrm{\sum{Unit\,cost \times Quantity}}$
2. Determine the total number of units sold: $\mathrm{\sum{Units\,sold}}$
3. Apply the inventory valuation method (to calculate **COGS**):
	- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**: Assume that the first units purchased are the first ones to be sold: 
	- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**: Assume that the most recently purchased units are the first ones to be sold: 
	- **Average cost**: Calculate the weighted average cost per unit by dividing the total inventory cost by the total quantity of units: $\mathrm{\frac{Total\,inventory\,cost}{Total\,quantity\,of\,units}}$
4. **Calculate the ending inventory**: Total inventory cost capitalised subtract COGS:  $\mathrm{(\sum{Unit\,cost \times Quantity})-COGS}$
5. **Calculate gross profit** -
   $\mathrm{Gross\,profit=Revenue-COGS}$

## Inventory systems
There are 2 systems for recording inventory:
- **Periodic inventory system** - where **Inventory values and COGS** - are determined at **end** of accounting period; **Purchases account** - records inventory acquired during the period
- **Perpetual inventory system** - have all the information updated when the **transactions occurred** continuously; **Purchases account** is not deemed necessary.

### Perpetual inventory system 
The perpetual inventory have all the information updated when the **transactions occurred** continuously. In each of the accounting method, will result in different ending inventory value except **FIFO**:
- **LIFO**
- **Average cost**

For the same example, the perpetual inventory system for different methods, **FIFO**:
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.20.15.png]]

Perpetual inventory system for different methods, **LIFO**:
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.20.44.png]]

Perpetual inventory system for different methods, **average cost method**:
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.21.16.png]]

### Comparison of the periodic and perpetual inventory system
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.22.21.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.23.34.png]]

The LIFO and weighted average cost methods can provide different values for inventory, cost of sales, and gross profit depending on whether the firm uses a periodic or perpetual inventory system. FIFO produces the same values from either a periodic or perpetual inventory system.

## LIFO method
The **LIFO method** is the "Last in, first out" method, in an inflationary environment, the first inventory bought is of a lower cost than the last inventory bought.

Therefore in comparison with the FIFO and LIFO method, the LIFO method result in higher COGS, lower inventory, lower net income and lower income tax.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.32.37.png]]

## LIFO reserve
**LIFO reserve** is the reserve amount by which the LIFO inventory is less than the FIFO inventory.

Since LIFO reported with higher COGS, and higher retained earnings, there are **additional cash balance from paying less taxes**. Since there is this difference, the company which uses the LIFO method must report the LIFO reserve.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 17.36.21.png]]

It is required for the firms to present the LIFO reserve and the analyst can covert the LIFO to FIFO in order to make meaningful comparison with the companies which report in FIFO.

#### Covert LIFO to FIFO
To convert **LIFO** inventory valuation to **FIFO**, you can follow the following steps:
1. **Inventory** in balance sheet: Add the LIFO reserve to LIFO inventory - $\mathrm{Inventory_FIFO = Inventory_LIFO + LIFO_{ending\,reserve}}$
2. **Cash** in balance sheet: subtract tax savings (i.e. remove the additional cash balance from paying less taxes) - 
   $\mathrm{Cash_FIFO = Cash_LIFO - LIFO_{ending\,reserve} \times Tax\,rate}$
3. **Retained earnings** in balance sheet (equity): -
   $\mathrm{RE_FIFO = RE_LIFO +LIFO_{ending\,reserve} \times (1-Tax\,rate)}$
4. **COGS** in income statement:
   $\mathrm{COGS_FIFO = COGS_LIFO - \Delta LIFO\,reserve}$ 
   where $\mathrm{\Delta LIFO\,reserve = (Ending\,LIFO\,reserve - Beginning\,LIFO\,reserve)}$

> Due to declining prices, Steffen Inc. has a LIFO reserve of â€“$20. Its income tax rate is 35%. If an analyst is converting Steffen's financial statements to a FIFO basis, which of the following adjustments is most appropriate?
> 
> Increase cash by $7.
> 
> Declining prices (negative LIFO reserve) would result in FIFO inventory being less than LIFO inventory. The balance sheet adjustment would decrease assets (inventory) by the $20 LIFO reserve. In addition, the analyst would increase cash by $7 ($20 LIFO reserve Ã— 35% tax rate). To bring the accounting equation into balance, the analyst would decrease shareholders' equity by $13 ($20 LIFO reserve Ã— (1 âˆ’ 35% tax rate)).

## LIFO liquidation
**LIFO liquidation** refers to a situation where a company using the LIFO inventory valuation method **depletes its older inventory layers and starts selling inventory that was acquired at lower costs**. This can occur when the quantity of goods sold exceeds the quantity of goods purchased or produced in a given period.

Implication of LIFO liquidation:
- **lower cost of goods sold (COGS)** - lower COGS figure reported on the income statement, which can lead to higher gross profit , higher operating income, and net income
- **distorted profitability measures** - LIFO liquidation can temporarily inflate a company's profitability
- **reduced inventory levels** - LIFO liquidation reduces the quantity of inventory on hand, which can impact future sales and operations. Lower inventory levels may result in supply chain disruptions, increased production costs, or potential lost sales opportunities.
- **tax implications** - since lower COGS leads to higher taxable income, the company may incur higher tax liabilities

## LIFO presentation and disclosure
The presentation and disclosure of inventory accounting method:
- The **cost flow method** used (LIFO, FIFO, specific identification or weighted average cost method)
- The **total** carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in **classification** (e.g. raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods)
- The carrying amount of inventories carried at **fair value less selling costs**
- The **COGS** - which is the amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the period
- The amount of **write-down** of inventories during the period
- The amount of **reversal** of any write-down including the circumstances or events that led to the reversal. (Note: reversal is prohibited under US GAAP)
- The carrying amount of inventories pledged as **security for liabilities** - Carrying value of inventories pledged as collateral is one of the required disclosures under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP.
