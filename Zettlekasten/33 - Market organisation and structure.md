## Functions of the financial system
The **participants** in the **financial system** are:
- Individuals
- Firms
- Governments

The 3 main functions of the financial system are:
- **Help these participants achieve their purposes** - save, borrow, issue equity capital, manage risks, exchange assets, utilise information
- **Determine the rates of return**
- **Capital allocation efficiency**

The financial system is best at fulfilling these roles:
- Markets are liquid
- Transaction costs are low
- Information is readily available
- Regulation ensures the execution of contracts.

### Financial system help participants to achieve their purposes
There are 6 main purpose of what financial system can offer:
- **Save** - individuals for retirement, firms fund future expenditures through stocks, bonds, certificate of deposit, real estate
- **Borrow** - individuals to buy house, education etc; firms fund capital expenditures; governments fund future expenditures
- **Issue equity capital** - firms can raise capital through equity, and in return share future profits with shareholders; investment banks help with issuance, analysts value the equity, and accounting standards ensures meaningful disclosures
- **Manage risks** - provide hedges against the risk (e.g. interest rate, currency value, commodity value, defaults on debt)
- **Exchange assets** - currency exchange for operational needs
- **Utilise information** - Investors who can identify assets that are currently undervalued or overvalued in the market can earn extra returns from investing based on their information.

### Financial system and rates of return
Financial system can be viewed as two distinct activities: **borrowing** and **lending**.
There are lenders and borrowers, the borrowing and lending can be viewed as **demand and supply of money in the financial system**. The **demand and supply are highly affected by the rate of return or interest rates**.

e.g. when interest rates are high, lenders will want to lend more as the returns are higher and the borrowers want to borrow less as the interest cost is high. As such, the supply of money will be high and the demand for money in the system will be low.

Lenders may be driven to lower their rates of lending such that more borrowers will be enticed to borrow more. This drives the money supply down on the money demand up until an equilibrium level where the supply equals to the demand. The **equilibrium interest rate**, the rate at which the amount the borrowers desire is equal to the amount that the lenders desire (i.e. supply = demand).

In many countries, the **central bank** plays an important role in guiding this **equilibrium** rate through **monetary policy.**

### Financial system and capital allocation efficiency
As capital is limited, the financial system should be structured so **funds are allocated that are most productive**.

In market based economies, lenders determine directly or indirectly which borrower obtains capital. Borrowers who have better **credit ratings** are perceived as being less risky.

So lenders with a lower risk appetite will be fine with lending, even though the rate of return is lower. Conversely, borrowers with poorer credit ratings will have to offer higher returns to convince investors to lend to them. The **regulators and standard setting bodies** have the responsibility to ensure that financial information is **accurately reported in the most useful manner** as the financial system is **efficient only if market information is accurate**.

## Assets, contracts, and markets
### Assets
Some of the commonly traded assets include:
- **Securities** - generally include debt instruments, equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles
- **Currencies** - money issued by a national monetary authorities
- **Commodities** - precious metals, energy products, industrial metals and agricultural products
- **Real assets** - real estate and other physical assets of value like airplanes or machinery

#### Securities
Securities are generally split into:
- **Fixed income** - debt securities that promise to repay the borrowed money in the future, pays regular interest and principle on fixed maturity date
	- short-term, intermediate-term (notes), long-term (bonds) (where normally less than 2 years considered short-term; 10 years above considered as long-term)
	- short-term - commercial paper (issued by firms); bills (issued by government); repo (sells valuable asset and buys back at higher price)
	- **Convertible debt** - option to be exchanged for a specified number of equity shares
- **Equity** - ownership in a firm
	- **Preferred stock** - dividends only paid after fulfilling interest payments to debt holders, no maturity date
	- **Common stock** - residual claims on assets, dividends only paid after preferred stock dividends, dividends not fixed, no maturity date
	- **Warrants** - right to buy common stock at an exercise price prior to expiration date
- **Pooled investment vehicles** - can be a mixture of all those securities mentioned above
	- e.g. mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETF), asset-backed securities, hedge funds; shares, units, depository receipts, LP interests
	- **Mutual funds** - can be **open-ended** or **close-ended:** where open ended allow participants to buy and sell shares back to the mutual fund on a daily bases (i.e. price = NAV/ number of outstanding shares); whereas close-ended fund are not allowed and the shares are issued in the primary market, can only sell through secondary market  (i.e. price $\ne$ NAV/ number of outstanding shares)
	- **Exchange traded funds (ETF)** - works similarly to close-ended mutual funds, but it has authorised participants (AP) to trade the ETF shares with portfolio shares when price < NAV or vice versa; therefore, (i.e. price $\approx$ NAV/ number of outstanding shares)
	- **Asset-backed securities** - pools of assets that are backed by **mortgages, credit card debt, car loans** - the interest + principle repayments according to the different tranches: senior, junior, and subordinated tranches
	- **Hedge funds** - limited partnerships (investors) - qualified investors (i.e. wealthy and well-informed), whereas the general partner (manager) - have management fee (based on AUM) and incentive fee (based on performance)

#### Currencies
**Currencies** are:
- money issued by national monetary authorities
- approximately 175 currencies are currently in use throughout the world
- Some of these currencies are regarded as **reserve currencies** - currencies that national central banks and other monetary authorities hold in **significant quantities** for international trade and as a foreign reserve
- **Primary reserve currencies** are the USD and EUR.
- **Secondary reserve currencies** include the GBP, JPY, CHF.

Spot exchange rate - immediate exchange 
Future exchange rate - future delivery

#### Commodities
There are several types of commodities:
- **Energy**
- **Base metals**
- **Precious metals**
- **Agriculture**
- **Carbon credits**

There are several markets:
- **Spot market** - tend to be primary producers trading in the spot market
- **Forward markets** - tend to hedge the risk from the opposing party (e.g. airline company vs oil company)
- **Future markets** - more liquid than spot and forward market, traders and investment managers speculate on future price and for hedging purposes

#### Real assets
There are some **real assets** for investments, including:
- Real estate
- Equipment
- Infrastructure

Real assets can be invested through:
- **Direct investment** 
	- benefits of direct investment: direct income, tax advantages, diversification benefits
	- downside of direct investment: management cost, require substantial due diligence, illiquid
- **Indirect investment** through investment vehicle
	- e.g. REITs, MLPs, stocks of related firms
	- benefits of indirect investment: more liquid than the direct investment

### Contracts
**Contracts** are generally agreements **between two parties** to perform **some action** in the future.
There are several types financial contract and commonly known as derivatives:
- **Forwards** - OTC markets, customised contracts, buy or sell certain asset at certain date
- **Futures** - Central exchange, standardised contracts, buy or sell certain asset at certain date
- **Swaps** - pay according to price of asset A, pays according to price of asset B over multiple settlement dates until expiry date (e.g. floating/fixed rate swap; currency swap; equity swap (return on index/interest payments))
- **Options** - LONG has the right to buy/sell an asset at specific price on or before a specific date and pays premium to the SHORT, which SHORT has to obliged to do so if LONG exercises the option
- **Insurance contracts** - pay premium to insurer to hedge against risk of occurrence of an unfavourable event before expiration date (e.g. life insurance, liability insurance, automobile insurance), credit default swaps - issuer defaults on its bonds for speculator and bond investor 

### Markets
All these assets trade in **markets**, which can be classified in a number of ways:
- **Delivery date**: Immediate delivery (spot) vs future delivery (forwards, future, options)
- **Source**: primary (new securities) vs secondary (subsequent sales of securities)
- **Maturity**: money market (1 year or less) (e.g. repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, government bills, commercial paper) vs capital market (1 year or more) (e.g. longer-term debt securities, equity securities)
- **Traditional vs. alternative**: traditional investment and alternative investment markets traditional investments - publicly traded debts and equities, shares in pooled investment vehicles that hold publicly traded debts and or equities like an equity index ETF; Alternative investments - hedge funds, private equities, commodities, real estate and infrastructure investments these investments are often hard to trade and hard to value, they often sell at a discount and require substantial investor due diligence.

## Financial intermediaries
**Financial intermediaries** stand between buyers and sellers facilitating:
- the exchange of assets
- capital
- risk

Their services allow for **greater efficiency** and are vital to a well functioning economy.

**Financial intermediaries** include:
- **Brokers and exchanges**
- **Dealers**
- **Securitisers**
- **Depository institutions**
- **Insurance companies**
- **Arbitragers**
- **Clearinghouses**

### Brokers and exchanges 
Brokers help their clients buy and sell securities by finding counter-party to trade in a cost efficient manner (e.g. **Block brokers** help with a placement of big trade size without moving the market), including:
- **Large brokerage firms**
- **Banks**
- **Exchanges** - a venue where different parties can trade with each other, electronic order matching, distinguished from brokers through regulation, required to provide faithful and timely financial disclosures
- **Investment banks** - sell common stock, preferred stock and bonds; provide advice to firms about M&A and raising capital.
- **Alternative trading systems (ATS)** - known as "dark pools", electronic communication networks (ECNs)/ multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) - popular with large investment  managers because market prices often move to their disadvantage when other traders know about their large orders. 

Brokers and exchanges facilitate trading through various means they **do not buy or sell the securities from the traders nor maintain an inventory of securities**.

### Dealers
**Dealers**: 
- buy and sell securities directly from the traders
- do maintain an inventory
- provide liquidity in the market and profit primarily from the bid-ask spread

Also, some dealers also act as brokers and vice versa, which is broker-dealer:
- When a client enters an order, broker dealers can choose to broker a deal with a counterparty or buy or sell the security directly from the client.
- an inherent conflict of interest.
- as a broker, it should seek the best prices for the client.
- as a dealer, its goal is to profit through prices or spreads.
- traders typically place limits on how their orders are filled when they transact with broker dealers.

### Securitisers 
**Securitisers**:
- intermediaries that pool large amounts of securities/assets and then sell interest in the pool to investors
- cash flows that go into the pool net of the fees are passed through to the investors 
- e.g. asset-backed securities that are commonly segregated into multiple categories called **tranches**, the senior tranches provide the most certain cash flows, while the junior and subordinated tranches have greater risk

Benefits of securitisation:
- Allows investors to invest according to their required risk and returns
- Minimum investment amount is lower
- Diversification benefits 
- More predictable cash flow
- Improved liquidity
- Economies of scale in the management costs of large pools of assets
- Potential benefits from the managers expertise in selecting assets.

Assets that are often securitised include:
- mortgages
- car loans
- credit card receivables
- bank loans
- equipment leases

**Special purpose vehicle (SPV)** is a type of asset-backed securities securitised by firms which set up a separate legal entity to buy some of its assets. This removes the assets from the firm's balance sheet and may increase their value to investors as the assets are now bankruptcy remote from the originating firm. Creditors of the firm cannot lay claim to the assets sold to the SPV.

#### Depository institutions
There are 4 major types of depository institutions:
- **Banks**
- **Payday lenders/factoring companies**
- **Securities broker** - provide loans to investors who purchase securities on margin.
- **Prime broker** - when the margin lending is to hedge funds and other institutions

**Depository institutions**, commonly know as **banks**:
- banks take on customer deposits
- pay interest on them and provide transaction services such as checking account
- make loans to various borrowers
- with the loans, firms/individuals pay interest on their loans
- have cash flows for the bank to pay interest on the deposits.

Most banks have expertise in **evaluating credit quality** and **managing the risk** of a portfolio of loans of various types.

**Other intermediaries** lend money to firms and individuals:
- payday lenders
- factoring companies 
on the basis of their wages, accounts receivable and other future cash flows. These intermediaries often finance the loans by issuing **commercial paper or other debt securities**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 23.11.15.png]]

Regardless of the type of depository institution, the deposits from the depositors and the debt from the lenders can be considered the **liabilities** of the **institution in its balance sheet**. There are also stockholders who **supply capital to institutions**, and this forms the equity capital.

The stockholders absorb any **loan losses** before the lenders and depositors as such, the more **equity capital the institution has, the less risk for depositors**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 23.15.44.png]]

### Insurance companies
**Insurance companies**: 
- Collect insurance premiums in return for providing risk reduction to the insured.
- provides protection to a diversified pool of policyholders whose risks of loss are typically uncorrelated
- this provides more predictable cash flows compared to a single insurance contract, much like that of a bank's diversified portfolio of loans.
- connect the **buyers of their insurance contracts** with **investors** (e.g. creditors and reinsurers) who are **willing to bear the insured risks**, the buyers can be seen as transferring their risks to the investors who are willing to assume such risks for some returns.

Insurance companies provide a benefit to investors by managing the risks inherent in insurance:
- **Moral hazard** occurs because the insured may take more risks once he is protected against losses.
- **Adverse selection** occurs when those most likely to experience losses are the predominant buyers of insurance.
- **Fraudulent claims** - the insurer purposely causes damage or fakes losses so they can make an insurance claim.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 23.18.27.png]]

### Arbitrageurs
**Arbitrageurs** trade:
- when they can identify opportunities to buy and sell identical or essentially similar instruments at different prices in different markets.
- connect sellers in one market to buyers in another market
- don't confuse arbitrageurs with dealers, dealers are intermediaries that connect buyers and sellers that arrive at different times in the same market, whereas arbitrageurs connect buyers and sellers that arrive at the same time in different markets
- purest form of arbitrage involves buying and selling the same instrument in two different markets, in markets with good information, **pure arbitrage is rare because traders will favour the markets with the best prices**
- More commonly, arbitrageurs trade securities or contracts whose values **depend on the same underlying factors**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 23.26.09.png]]

### Clearing house
**Clearinghouses**:
- act as escrow agents, transferring money from the buyer to the seller and transferring securities from the seller to the buyer 
- guarantee contract completion in future markets, making sure that both the long and the short fulfil their contractual agreement
- in margin trade, pose sufficient margin and limit the aggregate net order quantity of the members through these activities, through enforcing margin rules on both buyers and sellers
- limit counter-party risk, which is the risk that the other party to a transaction will not fulfill its obligation.

In some markets, the clearinghouse ensures only the trades of its member brokers and dealers, who in turn ensure the trades of their retail customers.

**Custodians** improve market integrity:
- holding clients securities, these services, which prevent the loss of securities through fraud, oversight or natural disaster

## Position and leverage
### Long vs short position in assets
Frequently traded assets are securities, commodities, currencies and real assets and an investor has to take a position in an asset.

The investor takes a **long** position when he owns an asset, long positions benefit from an **appreciation in the prices** of the assets owned the investor profits by purchasing at a low price and **selling at a high price** (i.e. buy low sell high).

Conversely, the investor takes a short position when he has sold assets that he does not own, **short** positions benefit from a **decrease in the prices of the assets** sold **short sellers profit by selling** at high prices and repurchasing at lower prices (i.e. sell high buy low).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 00.14.08.png]]

### Long vs short position in contracts (forwards/futures/swaps/options)
#### Forwards and futures
The **long** side of a **forward** **or futures contract** is the side that **will take physical delivery or its cash equivalent**.

The **short** is the side that is **liable for the delivery**, the value of the long increases when the value of the underlying asset increases, while the value of the short increases when the value of the underlying decreases.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 00.14.27.png]]

#### Swaps
In swaps, each party is long one asset and short the other, so the designation of the long and short side is often arbitrary. Usually the side that benefits from an increase in the quoted price or rate is referred to as the LONG side.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-23 at 16.08.55.png]]

#### Options
For **options** contracts, **SHORT** is the writer of the contract (satisfy the obligation if the long chooses to exercise) and the **LONG** is the holder of the contract (holds the right to exercise the option.). 

There are **call** options (right to buy) and **put** options (right to sell). Now, here is an anomaly, the **put** holder has a direct long position in the put option contract, but an indirect short position on the underlying asset, therefore the long put benefits when the underlying price goes down, while the short put benefits when the underlying price goes up.

e.g. The short put is obliged to buy the underlying if the long put decides to exercise the put option.

Buy the asset â‡’ long futures
Sell the asset â‡’ short futures

> Which of the following hedgers should take the short position?
> **A palm oil plantation owner should short palm oil futures**
> 
> An easy way to determine which position a hedger should take is to think in terms of what the hedger needs to do in the FUTURE.
> 
> - A coffee powder producer needs to BUY coffee beans in the future (long).  
> - A palm oil plantation needs to sell palm oil in the future (short).  
> - A car manufacturer needs to buy steel in the future (long).

### Short positions
There are several procedures for short sellers:
- **At initiation** - the short sellers simultaneously borrows from a security lender and sells the security, the **proceeds of the short sale must be left on deposit with the lenders as collateral to guarantee the eventual repurchase of the security**.
- may also be **required to deposit additional margin in the form of cash or short term riskless securities**. 
- **Short rebate rate** - earned by the **lender** then **earns interest on these funds and may return a portion of this interest to the short seller**, typically 0.1% per cent less than overnight interest rates. If the security is difficult to borrow, the short rebate rate may be lower or negative.
- **Payments-in-lieu of dividends/interest** describes the short seller **must pay to the lender all dividends or interest that the lender would have received from the security**.
- **Short covering** - short sellers closed their positions by repurchasing the securities and returning them to the security lenders.


![[Screenshot 2023-05-23 at 16.10.05.png]]

### Leveraged positions
**Margin loan** is amount of purchase of securities that is financed by borrowing, typically financed by the broker. The amount which is financed by the trader is termed as **equity** position. The equity position **must meet the initial margin requirement**, which can be set by the government exchange clearinghouse or broker.

The **leverage ratio** of a margin investment is the value of the asset divided by the value of the equity position, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Leverage\,ratio=\frac{Value\,of\,asset}{Value\,of\,equity}}$$

The **use of leverage magnifies both the gains and losses** and this additional risk is referred to as **risk from financial leverage**.

To protect broker themselves from a sharp drop in asset value, brokers usually enforce a **maintenance margin requirement** on the trader which is the minimum equity percentage that the trader must maintain in the account, typically 25% of the current position value but brokers may require a greater minimum equity percentage for volatile stocks.

The **maintenance margin requirement** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{\frac{Equity\,value}{Asset\,value} \ge Maintenance\,margin\,requirement}$$

If the % of equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the investor will receive a **margin call**, a request to bring the equity percentage in the account back up to the maintenance margin percentage.

An investor can satisfy this request by **depositing additional funds or depositing other non-margined securities** that will bring the equity percentage up to the minimum requirement. If the investor does not meet the margin call, the broker must sell the position.



The **margin call price** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Margin\,call\,price=P_0\times\frac{1-Initial\,margin}{1-Maintenance\,margin}}$$
where $P_0$: initial purchase price. 

where the **initial margin requirement** is calculated through:
$$\mathrm{Initial\,margin\,requirement\,in\,\%=\frac{Initial\,margin}{Asset\,price}}$$
and it can be substituted in the previous equation to calculate the margin call price.

#### Cost when trading leveraged position
There are several costs involved in margin purchase:
- **Call money rate** - pay the broker interest on the margin loan, generally higher than the government bill rate (for larger investors with better collateral, the call money rate is lower) 
- **Commission** - for the purchase and sale of the securities - paid on the entire position, not just the borrowed portion.

> Emily bought ABC stock at $20,000. She placed the required initial margin of $6,000, and the maintenance margin requirement was 20%. What is the margin call price for Emilyâ€™s purchase?
>  **$17,500**
>  Initial margin requirement = 6000/20000 = 30%
>  Margin call price = P0 x (1-Initial margin)/(1-maintenance margin)
>  = 20,000 x (1-0.3)/(1-0.2) = $17,500

> Emily bought ABC stock at $20,000. She placed the required initial margin of $6,000 with a broker which charges 0% commission and 4% call money rate. Two years later, she sold her position in ABC stock for $25,000, and collected $1,500 dividend during the period.
> 
> What is Emilyâ€™s actual % gain from this transaction? **+89.3%**
> Interest on margin loan = (20000-6000)x(1.04^2)-14000 = 1142.40
> 
> Amount received after 2 years = 25000(sale) +1500(dividend) -14000(repayment) -1142.40(interest)  = 11,357.60
> 
> % gain = 11,357.6 / 6000 = **+89.3%**

## Order instruction
Dealers buy and sell securities directly from the traders and primarily profit from the spread between the price they buy at "bid" and the price as they sell at "Ask". The **market quotation** in the market is the highest bid and lowest ask from among all dealers in a particular security.

The brokers/dealers are known as the market-makers and the investors are the market takers.

There are 3 major instructions when an order is set:
- **Execution instructions** - how to trade
- **Validity instructions** - when the order can be executed
- **Clearing instructions** - how to settle the trade

### Execution instructions
There are 2 types of execution order instructions:
- **Market orders** - execute immediately at the best possible price; appropriate when the trader wants to execute quickly, shortcoming is price uncertainty, especially if trading volume << order size
- **Limit orders** - a minimum execution price on sell orders and a maximum execution price on buy orders; no price uncertainty, assured that price is at limit price or better if filled, order may not be filled or completely filled

**Limit order** terminology:
- **Inside the market** - A limit order is "inside the market" when its specified price is equal to or better than the current best available bid or ask price (i.w. waiting to execute, standing limit orders)
- **Make the market** - best ask/bid, effectively "making the market."
- **Marketable** - at least part of the order will be immediately executed
- **Behind the market** - limit order's specified price is worse than the current best available bid/ask price (i.e. likely not executed)
- **Far from the market** - This term describes a limit order that is significantly away from the current bid or ask price, indicating that the specified price is far from the prevailing market conditions.
![[Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 00.29.52.png]]

There are **minimum trade size** for limit orders:
- **Not specified** - best-effort attempt to fill as many units
- **All-or-nothing** - executes only if whole order can be filled
- **Specified minimum** - trade only executes if the minimum size can be met

There are also **trade visibility** can also be specified:
- **Hidden order** - investors that have a large amount to trade; only the broker or exchange know the trade size
- **Specify display size** - only some of the trade is visible to the market, but the rest is not "iceberg orders" because part or most of the order is hidden from view. allow the investor to advertise some of the trade without revealing the actual size of the trade; way to estimate the liquidity of or buying interest in the security.

### Validity instructions
The validity instruction specify when the order can be executed:
- **Day orders** -  expire if unfulfilled by the end of the trading day.
- **Good till cancelled orders** -  last until they are filled or when the trader cancels the order
- **Immediate or cancel orders** - canceled unless they can be filled immediately; "fill or kill orders"
- **Good-on-close orders** - only filled at the end of the trading day; **market-on-closed** orders  if they are market orders; These are often used by mutual funds because their portfolios are valued using closing prices.
- **Good-on-open orders** - but not as common
- **Stop orders** - execute only when the stock price has been met, they're often referred to as stop loss orders because they can be used to prevent losses or to protect profits.

### Clearing instructions
**Clearing instructions**:
- usually standing instructions by the client and not attached to an order
- instructions specify how the trade is to be cleared and settled.
- **Retail trades** are typically cleared and settled by the **same broker** who arranged the trade.
- **Institutional trades** may be settled by a **custodian** or **another broker**, which might be the traders prime broker (e.g. broker A) for margin and custodial services while broker B engages other brokers for specialised arrangements

When a trader issues a sell order, one important clearing instruction is to specify whether it is a long sale or short sale through a long sale, the broker must confirm that the securities held are available for delivery if it is a short sale.

The broker must either borrow the security on behalf of the client or confirm that the client can borrow the security.

## Primary market
**Primary capital markets** refer to the **sale of newly issued securities** if it is the first time that the company is issuing shares to the public - initial public offering. Otherwise, the issues are called seasoned offerings or secondary issues.

A primary offering through the **public offerings** or as a **private placement** to qualified investors.

### Public offerings
**Public offerings** procedures require:
- assistance of an investment bank
- the issuer provides information about its finance and prospect, and the funds will be used
- the investment bank disseminates this information to interested investors and gets preliminary agreements to buy part of the issue (not actual orders, but are referred to as **indications of interest**)
- investment bank adjust the number of shares to be offered based on this.

The process of gathering indications of interest is referred to as **book building**.
In London, the book builder is referred to as the **book runner**. In Europe, an accelerated book build occurs when securities must be issued quickly.

The **public offering can proceed through**:
- **Underwritten offering** - the investment bank takes the role of an underwriter who agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and the bank.
	- If the issue is priced too high, it may be undersubscribed. In this case, the investment bank must buy the unsold portion in the case of an IPO.
	- If it's priced too low, the issue may be oversubscribed. Not every investor gets the amount they applied for, which may mean that the issuer is not getting a fair deal.
	- For large issues, a syndicate of investment banks and broker dealers helps the lead underwriter build the book.
	- The investment bank also agrees to make a market in the stock for a period after the issuance to provide price support for the issue.
	- In an underwritten offering, **investment banks have a conflict of interest** as the issuer's agents, they should set the price high to raise the most funds for the issuer. As underwriters, they would prefer that the price be set low enough that the whole issue sells. This also allows them to allocate portions of an undervalued IPO to their clients. This results in IPOs typically being underpriced.
	- Interestingly, some insurers may also prefer underpricing the IPO because **oversubscription** and the **subsequent trading above IPO price is good publicity** for the firm. Such an IPO is referred to as a **hot issue**

- **Best efforts offering** - the investment bank does not commit to purchase the whole issue; act only as a broker to issue the shares to interested investors, if the issue is undersubscribed, the issuer may not raise the desired amount.

### Private placement
**Private placement**:
- sells securities directly to a small group of qualified investors
- with the assistance of an investment bank, qualified investors or those with substantial wealth and investment knowledge.
- do not require the issuer to disclose as much information
- issuance costs may be lower than public offerings.
- are likely to require higher returns
- a lower price as the securities are less liquid as they cannot be traded in an organised secondary market.

### Other activities in private market
Other activities in the primary market include:
- **Shelf registrations** - a firm registered securities for issuance as an irregular offering, but only issues the registered securities over time when it needs capital and when the markets are favourable.
- **Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP)** - use dividends to buy new shares at a discount
- **Rights offerings** - existing shareholders are given the right to buy new shares are discount to the current market price; Shareholders tend to dislike rights offerings because their ownership is diluted unless they exercise their rights and buy the additional shares.

In addition to firms issuing securities, **governments issue short term and long term deb**t, either by **auction** or through **investment banks**.

## Secondary market
**Secondary market** provide investors to trade with existing securities among themselves. The use of secondary market is to provide liquidity - a liquid market is one in which a security can be sold quickly without incurring a significant discount from the current price.

The secondary market can be specified by:
- **when** - securities are traded 
- **how** - securities are traded

### When of securities are traded 
**Call market** - all interested buyers and sellers of a stock gather at a specific time and place to declare their bids and asks; then one negotiated price is set that clears the market for the stock.

A call market can be very liquid when in session because all traders are present, but they're obviously illiquid between sessions, call markets usually are organised just once a day, but some markets organised calls at more frequent intervals.

**Continuous trading market** - allow trades to be arranged and executed at any time the market is open. Mostly start their trading with a call market auction during a pre-opening period. Traders submit their orders for the market call at the opening. Any possible trades are arranged and then trading continues in the continuous trading session. Some continuous trading markets also close the trading session with a call.

### How the securities are traded
There are 3 major types of how to trade the securities:
- **Quote-driven markets** - investors trade with dealers (i.e. OTC markets)
- **Order-driven market** - rules match buyers and sellers (i.e. exchange or trading systems)
	- **Order matching rules** - which order gets priority over others and how the orders are matched (encourage traders to price aggressively, display entire order, trade earlier)
		1. **Price priority** - **highest bid** price, **lowest ask** price first
		2. **Non-hidden priority** - non-hidden order first
		3. **Chronological priority** - earliest orders first
- **Brokered markets** - use brokers to locate counter-parties
	- for unique or illiquid assets (e.g. large block of stocks, real estate, artwork)

### Order-driven market
**Order-driven market** - rules match buyers and sellers (i.e. exchange or trading systems)
	- **Order matching rules** - which order gets priority over others and how the orders are matched (encourage traders to price aggressively, display entire order, trade earlier)
		1. **Price priority** - **highest bid** price, **lowest ask** price first
		2. **Non-hidden priority** - non-hidden order first
		3.**Chronological priority** - earliest orders first

**Trade pricing rules** determine the price to be traded at:
- **Discriminatory pricing rules** - practiced in continuous markets, the order that arrived first determines the trade price
- **Uniform pricing rules** - practiced in call markets, all orders are traded at the same price that maximises trading volume
- **Derivative pricing rules** - practiced in crossing networks, price is derived from another market, the middle of the best ask/best bid

### Market information systems
There are 2 main types of market information systems:
 - **Pre-trade transparent** - publishes real-time data about quotes and orders 
	 - transparency allows better understanding of securities values and trading cost
 - **Post-trade transparent** - publishes trade prices and sizes only after trades occur 
	 - opaque market gives dealers informational advantage over traders who trade less frequently (e.g. higher transaction costs, higher bid-ask spreads)


## Well-functioning financial system
There are 6 main purpose of what financial system can offer and a well functioning financial system should:
- **Save** - allow investors to save for the future at fair rates of return
- **Borrow** - enable creditworthy borrowers to obtain funds through debt issuance
- **Issue equity capital** - enable creditworthy borrowers to obtain funds through equity issuance
- **Manage risks** - allow hedgers to easily trade away or offset risks
- **Exchange assets** - allow traders to easily exchange currencies, commodities, and any other assets they need
- **Utilise information** - Investors who can identify assets that are currently undervalued or overvalued in the market can earn extra returns from investing based on their information.

### Financial intermediaries and well-functioning financial system
A well functioning financial system has **financial intermediaries**:
- **Exchange, brokerages and alternative trading systems** - match buyers to sellers
- **Dealers** - provide liquidity on demand to traders
- **Securitisers** - lower interest costs for borrowers
- **Banks** - match investors to borrowers by taking deposits and making loans
- **Insurance companies** - pool uncorrelated risks.
- **Financial advisers** - help investors manage and grow their assets.
- **Clearinghouses** - ensure everyone settles their trades and contracts
- **Depositories** - ensure nobody loses their assets

### Well-functioning financial system characteristics
A well-functioning financial system should be:
- **Operationally efficient**
- **Informationally efficient**
- **Allocationally efficient**

A well functioning financial system has complete markets that are **operationally** and **informationally efficient** with prices **that reflect fundamental values**.

#### Operationally efficient market
If a market is **operationally efficient** to perform these functions at **low trading costs**, including:
- low commissions
- small bid-ask spreads
- price impact

#### Informationally efficient market
If a market is **informationally efficient**:
- security prices reflect all the information associated with fundamental value in a timely fashion
- reporting requirements and accounting standards that produce meaningful and timely financial disclosures allow analysts to for more accurate estimates of fundamental values

#### Allocationally efficient market
If a market is **allocationally efficient**:
- capital is allocated to its most productive use
- tremendous savers and investors can directly or indirectly fund companies that need capital for expansion or projects
- if the risk for certain projects is too high for the company to bear, the risk can be transferred to those that can better bear it.
- the transactions can occur among strangers, widening the opportunities for capital formation and risk sharing in the economy.

## Market regulation
There are several key problems that can persist in financial markets:
- **Fraud and theft** - investor placed trust in agents or investment managers to manage their wealth. Agents could steal or overcharge their clients if there are no safeguards in place. Since returns are often random, it can be easy for agents to attribute client losses to market underperformance
- **Insider trading** - if market insiders are allowed to trade based on their privileged information, the playing field will be skewed towards them at a cost to investors who do not have such information. Without assurance of a level playing field, traders without inside information will exit the market and liquidity will be reduced.
- **Costly information** - markets are not informationally efficient and investors will not invest as much.
- **Risk of defaults** - parties might not honour their obligations in the markets.

**Market regulation** is very important to any financial market, if market regulations fail to address these problems, financial markets do not function well as:
- Liquidity declines
- Firms shun risky projects
- New ideas go unfunded
- Economic growth slows

Here are some of the ways that the regulators can solve these problems:
- **Prevent fraud and theft** - requiring minimum standards of competency, and make it easier for investors to evaluate performance. The CFA program and the global investment performance standards are part of this effort.
- **Curb insider trading** - make it illegal and enforce the rules strictly such that traders are confident that the playing field is level
- **Costly information** - adherence to common reporting standard, e.g. (IFRS or US GAAP) reduces costs of information gathering and comparisons across companies
- **Risk of defaults** - require minimum levels of capital so that market participants will be able to honour their long term commitments. Companies have to be more careful about the risks they take.

**Regulations can be provided by**:
- Governments and related entities
- Industry groups - e.g. exchanges, clearing houses and dealer trade organisations
