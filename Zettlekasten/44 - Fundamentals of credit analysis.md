## Credit Risks
**Credit risk** is the risk associated with losses incurred by lenders from the failure of a borrower to make timely and full payments of principal and coupon of the bond issued

There are two components of credit risk:
- **Default risk** - is the probability that a borrower fails to pay interest or repay principal when due
- **Loss severity** - is the estimate of the value the lender may lose if the borrower defaults, it can be stated as the *monetary amount* or the *percentage of the bond’s due*

- **Expected loss** is the combination of both loss severity and default risk, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Expected\,loss = Loss\,severity \times Default\,risk}$$
where it can be stated in monetary value ($) or percentage of a bond’s value (%)
- **Recovery rate** is the percentage of a bond’s value (%) if the bond default, it is 	the $1-Loss\,severity$ in percentage, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Recovery\,rate = 1-Loss\,severity}$$
and represented as a percentage (%).

## Spread in bonds
- The percentage yield of risky bond in higher than the risk-free bond
- The **spread** is compared between risky and risk-free bond on similar maturity date.
- e.g. 2 year corporate bond (6.0%) vs 2 year treasury note (2.5%), the spread is 350bp.
- **Bond prices** are inversely related to spreads.
- The are spread risk increases the **spread** on both the borrower’s and the lender’s side:
	- The creditworthiness of the borrower (credit risk premium)
	- The liquidity of the markets (liquidity premium)
- The **credit migration risk** stems from the increase in spread due to the decrease in creditworthiness (i.e. downgrade risk)
- The **market liquidity risk** is due to receiving less than market value due to wider bid-ask spread, so when the liquidity is less, the spread increases. It can also be caused by:
	- Decrease in creditworthiness -> Increase in market liquidity risk
	- Decrease in issue size -> increase in market liquidity risk

## Capital structure
- The bond credit quality can differ between different companies or even the between the same issuer.
- There is a different seniority ranking, or also known as the the priority payment of the bond
- **Capital structure** includes, bank debt, bonds, preferred stock and common stock.
- There are different types of capital structure:
	- Straightforward capital structure - where all bonds are ranked equally
	- Complicated capital structure - different levels of seniority rankings

## Seniority rankings
The **seniority ranking** is important as the priority of payment in the event of liquidation of a company, where the highest will be paid first and the lowest will be paid last.
There are broadly two types of debt:
- **Secured debt** - Bondholders has *direct claim* on certain assets and their associated cash flows
- **Unsecured debt** - Bondholders has *general claim* on issuer’s assets and cash flows

**Secured debt** can be separated into:
- First lien/mortgage
- Senior secured
- Junior secured

**Unsecured debt** can be separated into:
- Senior unsecured 
- Subordinated - and can be further subdivided into:
	- Senior subordinated
	- Subordinated
	- Junior subordinated

### Why should there be a different level of seniority ranking from issuer’s perspective?
**Secured debt** provide high quality asset as collateral, lower interest rate.
**Unsecured debt** can be seen as an alternative to issuing new shares, to avoid diluting the existing shares.

### Why should there be a different level of seniority ranking from investor’s perspective?
- It allows to have a selection of risk/yield to match the investment objective
- **Secured debt** (investment grade debt) attract the insurance companies/pension funds 
- **Unsecured debt** as it is high yield, it appeal to investors who seek higher returns

## Credit default
- All debt within the same category is said to be rank **pari passu**, it is also known as the “waterfall structure” where the highest seniority ranking is paid in full first then to another grade
- Strict priority of claims - “Not always applied in practice”
- Due to the bankruptcy proceedings are costly and takes a long time to settle, the amount of recovery from liquidation might decrease due to:
	- Loss of customers
	- Loss of key employees
	- Mounting legal expenditures
- It might actually be that the senior debt holders do not get paid in full as the debt holders would like to settle the compensation quickly

## Credit ratings and rating agencies
**Credit rating agencies** assess the credit ranking of both the issuer and the individual debt issued and assign their ratings based on their risk of default

There are 3 major credit rating agencies:
- Moody’s
- S&P Global
- Fitch ratings

“AAA” means the highest rated bonds, “BBB-“ or “Baa3” higher is normally considered as investment grade
“BBB-“ or “Baa3” or lower are generally considered as non-investment grade, high-yield or junk bonds
If a company default in one of its outstanding bond, it triggers the **cross default provision**, where it will trigger the default on the remaining issues.

**Corporate family rating** is the overall creditworthiness of the company on their ***senior unsecured debt***.

**Corporate credit rating** depends on the seniority of issue and covenants

**Notching** is assigning different ratings to bonds of the same issuer, based on:
- Seniority
- Potential loss severity 
- Due to structural subordination
Notching is more common for lower-rated issuers/

### Structural subordination
There might be a subsidiary of a company from the parents company, and both companies have senior unsecured bonds
However, the asset cannot be transferred to upstream from subsidiary company to the parent company
**Debt covenant** prohibited from transferring assets/cash to parent before debt is serviced
In the event of a default of both subsidiary company and parent company, the subsidiary company have the priority claim to the subsidiary’s assets
Although the parent’s company senior unsecured bonds might theoretically have the same rank between as subsidiary’s senior unsecured bond, in reality, the parent’s senior unsecured bond is subordinated to the subsidiary (i.e. parent company’s same level bond is lower in seniority ranking compare to the subsidiary’s)
It may caused the credit rating agencies to notch the parent company bonds down.

## Risks in relying on credit rating agencies
Generally, credit rating agencies provide general accurate measure of default risk
Credit ratings are dynamic (also, ratings tends to be more stable, whereas lower rating tends to be less stable)
Credit rating lag market pricing - To study credit event (e.g. events such as cash flow problems can be predicted by studying a company’s financial statement)
Event risk is difficult to assess, for example: 
- Litigation risk such as tobacco control laws, environmental laws
- Natural disaster risk such as earthquake and tsunamis (e.g. Tepco in 2011)
- Leveraged transactions such as debt-financed acquisitions and large stock buybacks as it affects the capital structure and thus the debt quality of the bonds and company
- Rating agencies are not perfect

## Corporate credit analysis
**Credit analysis** is to determine whether the issuer’s ability to fulfil its debt obligations to the Bondholders
It is important to assess the company and the fundamental industry which the company operates in
There are 4 key components of credit analysis, also known as 4“C”s:
- **Capacity** - Borrower’s ability to repay
- **Collaterals** - Company assets for loss recovery
- **Covenants** - Protects the bondholder’s interest
- **Character** - Management’s integrity

### Key component of credit analysis - Capacity 
**Capacity** refers to the ability to repay debt obligations on time
Capacity refers to three levels:
- Industry structure
- Industry fundamentals
- Company fundamentals
**Industry structure** can be described by Porter’s 5 forces, and it’s discussed in details under the equity portion of CFA syllabus, where Porter’s 5 forces:
- Existing competition
- New competitors
- Power of suppliers 
- Power of buyers
- Threat of substitution

**Industry fundamentals** is determined by the influence of macroeconomics, and put focuses on three major factors:
- **Cyclicality** - If the industry is depending on the cycle, the earning volatility increases, and there is an increase in default risk
- **Growth prospect** - If the industry is in a slow growing/declining industry there is a greater risk of default risk for weaker companies
- **Industry published statistics** - The statistics can be from rating agencies, investment banks, industry periodicals and government agencies

**Company fundaments** such as these factors should be studied:
- **Competitive position** - as the company should have the competitive position, the market share changes over time and the cost structure relative to its peers
- **Operating history** - Performance over different phases of business cycle, trends in margin and revenue, is it due to the current management?
- **Management’s strategy and execution** - i.e. the soundness of strategy, the ability to execute, the effects of decisions on Bondholders should be considered
- It can also be calculated through **ratios and ratio analysis**

### Key component of credit analysis - Collateral
- **Collateral** is the assets to repay in the event of default
- It is more important for less creditworthy companies
- The collateral value (i.e. using the book value vs. market value) depends on the type of the asset
- **Intangible assets** such as these have different values:
	- **Patents** - more easily sold to generate cash flows
	- **Goodwill** - usually written down when the company’s performance is poor
	- **Human and intellectual capital** - may not be on the balance sheet but can be very valuable, e.g. software companies, investment management firms
- **Depreciation** is another import factor to consider, increase in depreciation expense, decrease in capital expenditure -> decrease in operating cash flows => increase in loss severity
- **Equity market capitalisation**, if the P/B or the price-to-book value is less than 1, it may indicate that the assets maybe of low quality

### Key component of credit analysis - Covenants
- The terms and conditions the borrowers and lenders have agreed to as part of a bond issue - it has to protect both the lenders and operating flexibility to the borrowers
- There are two types of covenants:
	- Affirmative covenants
	- Negative covenants
- **Affirmative covenants** includes
	- Make timely payments of principal and interest
	- Maintain certain ratios within prescribed limits
	- Maintain collateral, if any, in working order
- **Negative covenants** include:
	- Issuing more debt
	- Increasing dividends or repurchasing shares
	- Engaging in mergers and acquisitions
- The covenants should try to strike a balance which protects both the lenders and borrowers, should investigate whether these covenants protect lender interest without unduly constraining the borrower

### Key component of credit analysis - Character
- **Character** describes the management’s integrity and its commitment to repay the loan
- It can be assessed though several ways in combination to one and another:
	- **Soundness of strategy**
	- **Track record** - in executing strategy and operating the company
	- **Accounting policies and tax strategies**(warning signs: inappropriate revenue recognition policies, frequent restatements, frequently changing auditors)
	- **Record of fraud**or other legal and regulatory problems
	- **Treatment of Bondholders** - Should analyse the history whether the company has a biased treatment to equity holders at the expense of Bondholders (e.g. debt-financed acquisitions, special dividends)

## Ratios and ratio analysis for capacity of credit analysis
- **Ratios** are part of the company’s fundamental, and are calculated to assess the viability, find trends over time, compare to industry and peers
- Understand the **continuous and sustainable cash**(i.e. profits and cash flows) to repay and service debt, therefore, it should be those recurring items (net income from continuing operations from income statement should be considered)
- **Non-cash items** such as depreciation and amortization should be excluded
- **Cash based items** that are not from the income statement has to be included as well, i.e. **cash expenditures** such as capital expenditure, working capital investment

## Metric for continuous and sustainable cash to repay debt (income statement)
- Since servicing debt should come from the continuous cash income, analyzing the profits and cash flow through metrics are important.
- There are 5 major metrics from the *income statement* to consider to understand whether the company can fulfill it’s debt obligations:
	- EBITDA
	- FFO
	- FCF
	- FCF after dividends
	- Interest expense
- **EBITDA** is important measure, which is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -> it is a good approximation of the cash the company generates from its day-to-day operations available to repay its debt 
$$\mathrm{EBITDA = Operating\,income+Depreciation\,\&\,Amortisation}$$
where the problem is it does not adjust(include) the capital expenditure and working capital investment.
- The cash used for those purposes (i.e. capital expenditure and working capital investment) are not available to pay off debt, but this is not adjusted in EBITDA
- **Funds from operation (FFO)** is similar to **CFO**, except that it excludes working capital investments
$$\mathrm{FFO = Net\,income\,(from\,contin.\,ops.)+Depreciation\,\&\,Amortisation+Other\,non\,cash\,items}$$
where it has the same drawback for **EBITDA** as it does not adjust for the capital expenditures and working capital investments
- **Free cash flow (FCF)** is similar to the FFO except it is adjusted for the capital expenditure and working capital investments
$$\mathrm{FCF = Net\,income\,(from\,contin.\,ops.)+Depreciation\,\&\,Amortisation+Other\,non\,cash\,items-Capital\,expenditure-Working\,capital\,investment}$$
where it means the excess cash company generates after taking into account the cash spent on investments to sustain operations, before dividend, available to debt and equity holders.
- The most accurate of them all is **Free cash flow (FCF) after dividends**  
$$\mathrm{FCF = Net\,income\,(from\,contin.\,ops.)+Depreciation\,\&\,Amortisation+Other\,non\,cash\,items-Capital\,expenditure-Working\,capital\,investment-Dividends}$$
where if the FCF after dividends is > 0, there are excess cash to pay down debt or accumulate on the balance sheet, increased in creditworthiness (and deleveraging)
- **Interest expense** is the interest costs on the outstanding debt

## Ratios for continuous and sustainable cash to repay debt (balance sheet with income statement) - Leverage ratios
There are from the balance sheet:
- The short-term and long-term debt
- Underfunded pension plans
- Operating leases
- Total capital (i.e. total debt+total equity)

**Leverage ratio** is used to calculate the company’s fundamentals in servicing debt, and it includes:
- **Debt-to-EBITDA** - i.e. $\frac{Total\,debt}{EBITDA}$ - higher in leverage, increase in credit risk, it is more volatile for firms in cyclical industries
- **FFO-to-debt** i.e. $\frac{FFO}{Total\,debt}$ - higher in FFO-to-debt, means more cash to service the debt and lower the credit risk
- **FCF-to-debt** i.e. $\frac{FCF}{Total\,debt}$ - higher the FCF-to-debt, more cash to service the debt and lower the credit risk
- **Debt-to-capital** i.e. $\frac{Total\,debt}{Capital}$ - higher the debt-to-capital, means higher the leverage and higher the credit risk, some intangible assets (e.g. goodwill) may need to be excluded from total capital

### Ratios for continuous and sustainable cash to repay debt (balance sheet with income statement) - Coverage ratios
**Coverage ratios** measure the borrower’s ability to generate cash flows to meet interest payments
The 2 common coverage ratios are:
- **EBIT-to-interest expense** - Higher EBIT-to-interest, higher cash flows to service interest, lower credit risk
- **EBITDA-to-interest expense** - higher EBITDA-to-interest, higher cash flows to service interest, lower credit risk
	- It is used more often than EBIT-to-interest
	- No depreciation/amortisation expense ⇒ higher (more aggressive) than EBIT-to-interest

## Ratios and credit rating
Analyst can refer to the credit agencies benchmark ratio for each industry to evaluate the credit rating of the company
It evaluates:
- Operating margin
- Debt-to-EBITDA
- FCF-to-debt
- Debt-to-capital
- EBITDA-to-interest

## Credit risk and spreads
**Yield spread** is the difference in yield between a credit risky bond and a credit risk free bond of similar maturity. **Bond prices** are inversely related to spreads.

The size of the spread reflects:
- the credit worthiness of the issuer (credit risk premium)
- the liquidity of the market for its bonds (liquidity premium)

e.g. a decrease in credit worthiness of the issuer will result in an increase in spread
e.g2. a decrease in liquidity will likewise increase the spread

There are also 5 other factors which affect the **yield spreads**:
- **Cyclical credit cycle** - The market's perception of overall credit risk is cyclical (i.e. the improved credit cycle with low credit risk has narrower yield spread, and vice versa, the highest risk being when there is a deteriorating credit cycle)
- **Economic conditions** - (i.e. strengthening economy will have the narrow spread since there is a rising corporate cash flows, thus reducing the risk of defaulting, and vice versa, weakening economy, the lenders require a greater risk premium, and the spreads widens)
- **Financial markets** - (i.e. strong market condition leads to low volatility in market condition, and the spreads narrow, and vice versa)
- **Broker-dealer capital** - the broker-dealers willingness to provide sufficient capital for market making (i.e. sufficient capital then narrow yield spread and vice versa, if the capital is scarce, the spread widens - e.g. 2008 economic crisis)
- **Demand vs. supply** - (i.e. if the supply < demand, then the spreads narrows, if supply > demand, then the spread widens) ⇒ insufficient demand to suck up new supply ⇒ spread increases

The spread tends to be more affected and volatile of the lower quality issue and less sensitive if the quality issues are high.

## Price impact from changes in yield spreads
According to the equation of **modified duration**, the equation is listed below:
$$\mathrm{\Delta price\approx-Modified\,duration\times\Delta YTM}$$
where change in price is approximate to the modified duration with change in YTM, and this is only applicable to approximation of small change in YTM (including spread) modified duration is the sensitivity of the bond price to the change in YTM, it can be calculated by $\mathrm{\frac{Macualay\,duration}{YTM}}$ and the unit of modified duration is in years.

The change of **yield to maturity (YTM)** is composed of two components, change of spread and change of benchmark yield, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{\Delta YTM = \Delta Spread + \Delta Benchmark}$$
 
![[Screenshot 2023-05-23 at 20.02.37.png]]

For larger change in spread (part of the equation of YTM), accounting for the curvature to give a better approximation.

The equation for calculating the change in price with convexity is as follows:
$$\mathrm{\Delta price\approx-Modified\,duration\times\Delta YTM+\frac{1}{2}\,convexity\times(\Delta YTM)^2}$$
where the YTM can be substituted with any components of the YTM, which includes, spread (tax premium, liquidity premium, credit premium) and benchmark yield (real return and expected inflation).

## Special considerations of high yield credit analysis
- **High yield bonds** are the junk bonds, are known as the non-investment grade bonds are the BBB- or Baa3 or lower rated bonds.
- Reasons for non-investment grade ratings:
	- Highly leveraged capital structure
	- Weak or limited operating history
	- Low or negative free cash flow
	- Low confidence in management
	- Unclear competitive advantages
	- Large off-balance-sheet liabilities
	- Declining industry
- Since high yield bonds have higher risks of default, analysis should be focused on the recovery analysis, more in-depth analysis, with **special considerations**
- **The special considerations of high yield bonds** includes:
	- Liquidity
	- Financial projection
	- Issuer: Debt structure
	- Issuer: Corporate structure
	- Covenants

### High yield bonds - Liquidity
- The availability of cash from high yield issuers
- Those companies tend to have limited access to additional borrowings and more expensive
- Financial news include macroeconomic news would hit those companies more than stable companies
- Most high yield issuers are privately own and can’t get access to equity market

**6 sources of liquidity for high yield bonds**, in the order from **strongest to weakest**:
- Cash on balance sheet
- Working capital (i.e. $\mathrm{Current\,assets - Current\,liabilities}$) - examine its use in company cash-conversion cycle
- Operating cash flow (CFO) - Sales -> Receivables -> Cash
- Bank credit - may require covenants
- Equity issuance - unreliable source if issuer is private or market condition is poor
- Asset sales (long-term assets) - highly uncertain potential value and actual time of closing

- If the company is short on cash (without financing, refinancing and service existing debt), the liabilities might due soon, and the high yield issuer might have to default.

### High yield bonds - Financial projections
- Forecast future earnings and cash flow for certain years to understand whether the high yield bond issuer is at risk of default
- The analyst should also project changes in capital expenditure and working capital
- Stress scenario should be simulated for these issuers

### High yield bond issuers - Debt structure
- **High yield bond issuers** tend to have bonds with **different seniorities** and hence varying level of **loss severity**
The debts of high yield bonds tend to have these, with the highest seniority listed first:
- Bank debt
- Second lien
- Senior unsecured 
- Subordinated
- Preferred stock

- Some of the debt are convertible to common shares
- If the company already has a lot of bank debt + second lien, it’s known to be top heavy, and the company has less capacity to have further borrowing from banks, therefore, more likely to default and lower recovery rates for unsecured debt holders
- Whereas the light top has more capacity to borrow from banks => lower probability for default, and the bondholders own more of the assets in the case of default, it makes light top unsecured debts more attractive to investors

Should calculate the leverage ratio of each level to determine how top heavy or light top, there are few leverage ratios that can be used:
- Secured debt leverage
- Secured unsecured leverage
- Total debt leverage
- Net leverage

The **secured debt leverage** is calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{Secured\,debt\,leverage=\frac{Secured\,debt}{EBITDA}}$$
The **secured unsecured leverage** is calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{Secured\,unsecured\,leverage=\frac{Secured+Senior\,unsecured}{EBITDA}}$$
The **total debt leverage** is calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,debt\,leverage=\frac{Total\,debt}{EBITDA}}$$
**Net leverage** is calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{Net\,leverage=\frac{Total\,debt-cash}{EBITDA}}$$

### High yield bond - Corporate structure
- Holding company structure, where the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries as primary source of income
- The subsidiary bond holders will be paid on the earnings before paying to the parent company, which then will be paid to parent bondholders, which is also known as structural subordination
- Bonds by parent company are subordinated by the subsidiary
- Parent company’s bond rating might be higher than the subsidiary because the earnings could be through multiple subsidiary companies, i.e. multiple cash flows from diverse subsidiaries can improve the parent’s credit rating

### High yield bond - Covenants
**Covenants** in high yield bond are important because of **reduced margin of safety**

The bond convents include:
- **Change of control put**
- **Restricted payments**
- **Limitation on liens**
- **Restricted/Unrestricted subsidiary**

- **Change of control put** - Right to require issuer to buy back bonds in the event of an acquisition, it protects the lenders from being exposed to a weaker, more indebted borrower as a result of the acquisition
- **Restricted payments** - Protect lenders by limiting how much cash can be paid out to shareholders, restricted amount can grow with increased retained earnings or cash flow
- **Limitation on liens** - Put limits on how much secured debt the issuer can have, to increase the recovery amount available to unsecured debt holders in the event of default
- **Restricted/Unrestricted subsidiary** 
	- ***Unrestricted - structural subordination***, subsidiary’s bondholders have priority on the subsidiary’s cash flows and assets,
	- **Restricted - pari passu** - subsidiary’s cash flows and assets can be used to service parent’s debts
- Also, there are also bank covenants, typically more restrictive, and can block additional loans until the violation is corrected, it can trigger a default if violation is not resolved, accelerating full repayment of loan

## Reason in investing in high yield bonds
- It is the middle instrument in historical return between investment-grade bonds and equity
- screen shot here
- Investment-grade bonds are highly influenced by interest rate changes, whereas equity is highly influenced by economic growth, high yield bond are slightly influenced by interest rate changes and influenced by economic growth.

## Enterprise value and high yield bonds
- Enterprise value to analyse high yield bonds, enterprise value is a measure of what a business is worth before any takeover premium
- Since taking over the company requires buying all the total debts and the equity market capitalization, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{EV=Total\,debt+Equity\,market\,capitalization-cash}$$
where EV: enterprise value
- The enterprise value indicate a firm’s potential for additional leveraged from a leverage buy out
- The analyst can compare the EV-to-EBIDTA and Total debt-to-EBITDA ratio
$$\mathrm{\frac{EV}{EBITDA}-\frac{Total\,debt}{EBITDA}}$$
Where the wider differences between the EV-to-EBITDA to total debt-to-EBITDA have greater equity compare to debt, and lesser credit risk.

## Special considerations of sovereign and non-sovereign credit analysis
- The default risk of sovereign credit are low, the analyst should focus on the aspects of the issues.
- **Sovereign debt** are issued by the governments 
- The ability to pay and the willingness to pay
- Due to sovereign immunity, there is no way to force the government to pay, therefore the willingness to pay is the most important 

There are 5 key areas to evaluate:
- Institutional effectiveness
- Economic structure and growth
- International investment position
- Fiscal Flexibility 
- Monetary Flexibility 

**Institutional effectiveness** includes:
- The history of successful and predictable policy making
- Absence of corruption
- Commitment to honor debts

**Economic structure and growth** includes:
- Stable and above average GDP growth
- Young and growing population
- High income per capital
- Lean public sector 

**International investment position** includes:
- Large foreign reserve
- Low foreign debt
- Currency that is actively traded and used

**Fiscal flexibility** includes:
- Willingness and ability to ensure debt service
- Stable or declining trend in debt/GDP

**Monetary flexibility** includes:
- Maintaining a free floating currency
- Credible and operationally independent central bank
- Well developed banking system in the country

## Local vs foreign currency denominated sovereign debt 
- The credit rating agencies have two denomination for the sovereign debt, which one is for the local currency and the other is for the foreign currency.
- Local currency - It can simply print local currency to repay
- Foreign currency - it has to be purchased to repay form the global markets, it can’t print its way out of a foreign currency debt, thus a higher default rate
- When the local currency is printed to repay the local currency debt, the local currency depreciates and it is harder to make repayments in foreign currency

## Non-sovereign debt
**Non-sovereign debt** can be issued both by the municipal government or quasi-government entities

Bonds issued by the US government are the municipal bonds: 
- Interest payments are tax-exempt
- Very low default rate 

**Municipal bonds** can be classified as one of the two:
- **General obligation bonds**
- **Revenue bonds**

**General obligation bonds** are **unsecured** bonds back by the full faith credit of the issuing governmental entity:
- It can’t print money to service debt
- Debt repayment has to come from local taxes
- Focus: local economy (e.g. Employment, trends in per capital income and debt, tax base dimensions, demographics, ability to attract new jobs)
- Revenue variability over economic cycles (i.e. heavy reliance on highly variable taxes, e.g. capital gains)
- Long-term obligations (e.g. pensions)

**Revenue bonds** are issued to finance specific projects (e.g. airports, toll bridges, hospitals):
- The project is the sole source of funds to service debt 
- **Higher credit risk**
- Focus: Analysis of project
- Using technique similar to those analysing corporate bonds
