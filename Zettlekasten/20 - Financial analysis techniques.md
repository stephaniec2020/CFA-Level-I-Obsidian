## Financial statement analysis framework
There are 6 steps to follow in analysing financial statements:
1. State the objective and context
2. Gather the data
3. Process the data
4. Analyse and interpret
5. Report
6. Update the analysis

### 1. State the objective and context
- **Objective** - questions to answer from the analysis, presentation format
- **Context** - what resources and how much time are available
- **Timeframe** - Short term (6-9 months), Long term (years ahead)

### 2. Gather the data
- Gather financial statements (quantitative data)
- Other relevant data on the industry and economy (quantitative and qualitative data)
- SWOT analysis (qualitative data)
- Company's business, competitive stance and future directions
- Interview management, suppliers and customers to get more qualitative data
- Publicly available data - including government - Bureau of Labor Statistics, the FED, US Census Bureau, and FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)

### 3. Process the data
- Make suitable adjustments to compare with other companies or industry average
- Transform the qualitative data into quantitative data
- Generation of ratios
- Produce graphs
- Common-size balance sheet

### 4. Analyse and interpret
- Depending on the objective and context, give out advice or recommendations

### 5. Report
- Highlighting the conclusion and recommendations with supporting information
- Comply with the code of standards of practice handbook Standard V(B)
	- Distinguish clearly between opinions and facts 

### 6. Update the analysis
- Periodic review and updates are required to update the analysis
- To understand whether the conclusions and recommendations are still valid

## Analytical tools and techniques
There are 4 major ways of analysis:
- Common-size analysis
- Graphical analysis
- Regression analysis
- Ratio analysis

### Common-size analysis
**Common-size analysis** normalised and make balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement comparable between firms or periods.

There are two types of common-size statement:
- **Vertical common-size statement** - includes cross-sectional (i.e. compare across firms) or time-series (i.e. compare single firm across period)
- **Horizontal common-size statement** - ratios compared against the first item. 

### Graphical analysis
Types of graphical analysis:
- **Pie-graph** - communicate the composition of a total value, however, it is limited to a snapshot at a particular time
- **Line-graph** - observe changes in values of the individual items over time, however, it is difficult to visualise the composition and the trend in total value
- **Stacked column graph** - observe composition and total values over time

### Regression analysis
**Regression analysis** can help:
- identify the relationships between variables (independent variable vs dependent variable) e.g. whether a company is cyclical - plot the revenue against GDP
- useful forecasting tool to predict future trend e.g. sales against time to predict future revenue

### Ratio analysis
- Limitations of financial ratios
	- Financial ratios are not useful when viewed in isolation
	- Different accounting treatments (due to the differences in accounting treatment of the items that constitute as earnings)
	- Divisions operate in different industries
	- All ratios must be viewed relative to one another
	- Range of acceptable values rather than target
	- Definitions can vary widely amongst analysts
- Context is important and the ratio should only be compared with prior periods or with its competitors
- The goal is to understand the underlying causes of divergences between a company's ratio and those of the industry
- Consistent ratios may indicate accounting manipulations
- The company's financial ratios can be evaluated based on:
	- **Company goals and strategy** - Have the objectives been met? As the results consistent with the strategy?
	- **Industry norms** - company ratios vs. industry averages **Note:** Ratios may be industry specific, multiple lines of businesses distort the aggregate ratios, differences in accounting methods
	- **Economic conditions** - throughout the business cycle, tends to be stronger during economic boom and weaker in the economic recessions

## Ratios and measurement of company performance
- The financial ratios are not mutually exclusive
- Since the Balance sheet have beginning of reporting period and ending of reporting period, whereas the income statement only has the ending period, the general rule of ratio calculation:
	- Compare the values of the current income statement
	- Compare the ending values from the current balance sheet
	- If it's comparing between two periods where one value is beginning and the other should use the average of both items (i.e. $\mathrm{\frac{(beginning+ending)}{2}}$)

The categories of financial ratios are:
- **Activity** - the efficiency of day-to-day task/operations
- **Liquidity** - measure the ability to meet short-term liabilities 
- **Solvency** - measure the ability to meet long term obligations
- **Profitability** - measure the ability to generate profitable sales 
- **Valuation**

## Activity ratios
**Activity ratios** measure the efficiency of day-to-day task/operations (i.e. receivables and inventories), that is the reason the **activity ratios** mostly use **revenue** as the denominator. Activity ratios are also known as asset utilisation ratios or operating efficiency ratios
It measures the efficiency of a firm in using its assets - where efficiency has a direct impact on **liquidity** (e.g. payables turnover)

**Total asset turnover** measure the efficiency of a firm in generating revenue using its total asset:
$$\mathrm{Total\,asset\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,total\,asset}}$$
**Note:** - different industries have considerably different ratios (e.g. manufacturing have low ratios), ratio can reflect management strategies (e.g. capital intensive approach have low ratios), analyse **working capital turnover** and **fixed asset turnover** separately for clearer distinction

**Fixed asset turnover** measure the efficiency of a firm in generating revenue using its fixed asset in investment:
$$\mathrm{Fixed\,asset\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,net\,fixed\,asset}}$$
where net: net of accumulated depreciation

**Note:** fluctuation in net fixed assets can distort the true-efficiency of the firm, newer assets â‡’ less depreciation â‡’ lower ratio, older asset â‡’ more depreciation â‡’ higher ratio

**Working capital turnover** measure the efficiency of a firm in generating revenue using its fixed working capital:
$$\mathrm{Working\,capital\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.working\,capital}}$$
where $\mathrm{Working\,capital = Current\,assets-Current\,liabilities}$
**Note:** working capital can be zero or negative for some companies, have to use **total asset turnover** or **fixed asset turnover** in such cases

**Inventory turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its inventory:
$$\mathrm{Inventory\,turnover=\frac{COGS}{Avg.Inventory}}$$
where COGS: cost of goods sold

**Days of inventory on hand (DOH or DIO)**, is an extension of the **inventory turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DOH=\frac{365}{Inventory\,turnover}}$$
Higher DOH or DIO means that inventory is not getting sold quickly, which can be overstocking or slowing of sales

Low inventory turnover (high number of days in inventory) may be a sign of **slow-moving or obsolete inventory**, especially when coupled with low or declining revenue growth compared to the industry. Low inventory value compared to cost of goods sold, however, implies a high inventory turnover ratio. This suggests much less risk of obsolescence.

The inventory turnover ratio and the number of days in inventory can be **used to evaluate the relative age of a firm's inventory** as well as the **effectiveness of a firm's inventory management.**

**Receivables turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its receivables:
$$\mathrm{Receivables\,turnover=\frac{Revenue}{Avg.Receivable}}$$
**Days sales outstanding (DSO)**, is an extension of the **receivables turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{DSO=\frac{365}{Receivables\,turnover}}$$
A high DSO (>45 days) mean that the firm is not collecting the money and a low one means the firm is efficiently collecting it.

**Payables turnover** measures the efficiency of a firm in managing its payables:
$$\mathrm{Payables\,turnover=\frac{Purchases}{Avg.Payables}}$$
where $\mathrm{Purchases = Ending\,inventory-Beginning\,inventory+COGS}$
**Note:** **COGS** is an income sheet item, **Payables** is a balance sheet item. Therefore, payables turnover is not a pure ratio.

**Number of days payable** **(days payable outstanding, DPO)**, is an extension of the **payable turnover** ratio, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Num\,of\,days\,payable=\frac{365}{Payables\,turnover}}$$
**Number of days payable** **(days payable outstanding, DPO)** tells how quickly you pay the suppliers, ideally, DSO < DPO, this means the firm is getting paid BEFORE paying the firm's suppliers

### Interpretation of different activity ratios
- **Number of days payable** 
	-  Low - May not be bad? Company may be getting early payment discounts?
	- High - Trouble making payments on time? Exploitation of lenient supplier terms?
	- Ideal - Follow the industry norm.
- **Days sales outstanding (DSO)**
	- Low - Company's credit policies too stringent? Loss of competitiveness?
	- High - Poor efficiency of credit and collection procedures?
	- Ideal - Follow the industry norm.
- **Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH)**
	- Low - Inadequate stock on hand?
	- High - Too much capital tied up in inventory? Inventory obsolete?
	- Ideal - Follow the industry norm.

## Liquidity ratios
- "Cash is King and Cash flow is Queen" â‡’ managing both well will result in better decisions and increased profitability
- **Liquidity ratios** measure the ability to meet short-term liabilities 
- **Cash conversion cycle** (CCC) means the time between the outlay of cash and the collection of cash, or simply, CCC is how long it takes from investment (purchase of inventory) to a collection of revenue (cash in hand).

$$\mathrm{Cash\,conversion\,cycle =DIO+DSO-DPO}$$
where lower CCC â‡’ Shorter period to finance inventory and receivable â‡’ higher liquidity 
while longer CCC â‡’ Longer period to finance inventory and receivable â‡’ lower liquidity
DOH: Days of inventory outstanding (time in inventory); DSO: Days sales outstanding (time as a receivable); DPO: Days payable outstanding (time to pay bills) 

CCC can be shortened through:
- decreasing the amount of time of holding onto inventory
- decreasing how long it takes to bill and then collect receivables
- increasing ho quickly you pay accounts payables

- The other way to payoff the expenses are from its assets
- **Defensive interval ratio** measure how long the company can continue to pay its expenses through its liquid assets
$$\mathrm{Defensive\,interval\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities-Receivables}{Avg. daily\,expenditure}}$$
where if the defensive interval ratio of 10, means that the company can expend for 10 days based on the assumption of no cash inflow.
High ratio â‡’ high liquidity; Low ratio â‡’ need sufficient cash inflow

### Cash burn rate and cash runaway
The cash burn rate and cash runaway can be run on a monthly or quarterly basis.
If profitable, this can help you understand:
- When to take distributions
- How long it'll take to afford an investment

$$\mathrm{Cash\,burn\,rate = \frac{(Cash\,balance\,beginning\,of\,period-Cash\,balance\,end\,of\,period)}{\#\,of\,months\,in\,period}}$$
If unprofitable, use your cash runaway to tell how many weeks you have left in operation:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,runaway = \frac{Total\,cash\,reserve}{Cash\,burn\,rate}}$$


There are also other ways to calculate the **liquidity ratio**, which has been mentioned in "understanding the balance sheet"; all of these ratios attempt to understand how quickly companies could meet short-term obligations:
- **Current ratio**
- **Quick ratio**
- **Cash ratio**

The **current ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Current\,ratio = \frac{Current\,assets}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
where the assumption of inventory and receivable in current assets are liquid
high current ratio means greater ability to meet short-term obligations, while low current ratio means less liquidity â‡’ reliance of cash flow from operation (CFO) or external financing

The **quick ratio** excludes the inventory from **current assets**, and the equation is as follows:$$\mathrm{Quick\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities+Receivables}{Current\,liabilities}}$$where **inventory is excluded** from the equation since some inventory cannot be converted to cash quickly; marketable securities are still some of the easier things to convert into cash

Stricter ratio which excludes receivables as well, the **cash ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
where marketable securities are short-term debt instruments which are liquid and of good credit quality.

## Solvency ratios
**Solvency ratios** measure the ability to meet long-term obligations. 
There are two types of solvency ratios:
- **Debt ratios** - based on balance sheet
- **Coverage ratios** - based on income statement

### Debt ratios
**Debt ratios** measures the amount of debt relative to the capital structure of the firm
The **debt** is different according to different analyst, the total debt equation under CFA curriculum is:
$$\mathrm{Total\,debt = Short\,term\,interest\,bearing\,debt+Long\,term\,debt}$$
it excludes the accred expenses and account payable from the liabilities. 

There are 4 ratios to calculate for the debt-to-something:
- Debt-to-equity
- Debt-to-capital
- Debt-to-assets
- Financial leverage

and 3 risk ratio indicators:
- Interest coverage
- Debt-to-EBITDA
- Fixed-charge coverage

A measure of the firm's use of fixed-cost financing sources is the **debt-to-equity-ratio**, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,equity\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,shareholders\,equity}}$$
Increases and decreases in this ratio suggest a greater or lesser reliance of debt as a source of financing.
e.g. Debt-to-equity ratio of 1 equals to the debt-to-capital ratio of 0.5.

Another way of looking at the usage of the debt is through **debt-to-capital-ratio**, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,capital\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,debt+Total\,shareholders\,equity}}$$
Capital equals to all short-term and long-term debt plus preferred stocks and equity. Increases and decreases in this ratio suggest a greater or lesser reliance of debt as a source of financing.

A different way of analysing debt utilisation is the **debt-to-asset-ratio**:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,asset\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,assets}}$$
e.g. If the company has a debt-to-asset ratio of 0.4, it means 40% of the company's asset can finance with debt

Another measure that is used as an indicator of a company's use of debt financing is the **financial leverage ratio**:
$$\mathrm{Financial\,leverage\,ratio = \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
Greater use of debt financing increases the financial leverage and, typically the risk to equity holders and bondholders alike.
e.g. If a company has a financial leverage of 3, it means $1 of equity supports $3 of total assets

![[Screenshot 2022-11-01 at 13.33.00.png]]

- The remaining ones 
**Interest coverage ratio** measure the number of times a company's earning can cover its interest payments:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage\,ratio = \frac{EBIT}{Interest\,payments}}$$
where EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes; â†‘ Interest coverage â‡’ â†‘ Solvency

**Fixed-charges coverage ratio** measure the number of times a company's earning can cover its interest payments + fixed-charge payments (i.e. lease payments):
$$\mathrm{Fixed\,charges \,coverage\,ratio = \frac{EBIT+Lease\,payments}{Interest\,payments+Lease\,payments}}$$
where EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes; â†‘ Fixed-charge coverage â‡’ â†‘ Solvency; it is more meaning for for companies that lease a large portions of their assets (e.g. airline companies)

![[Screenshot 2022-11-01 at 13.34.01.png]]

## Profitability ratios
**Profitability ratios** measure the ability to generate profitable sales from asset base, and measure the overall performance of the firm relative to revenues, assets, equity and capital.

There are 4 profitability ratios calculated from the **profits** from the **income statement** against **revenue**:
- Gross profit margin
- Operating profit margin
- Pre-tax margin
- Net profit margin

**Gross profit margin** is the margin of profit after the product cost, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Gross\,profit\,margin = \frac{Gross\,profit}{Revenue}}$$
If the gross profit margin is lower than the industry average, the prices might be too low or the costs are too high.

**Operating profit margin** is the margin of profit after the operating cost, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Operating\,profit\,margin = \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}}$$
If the operating profit margin increases faster than the gross profit margin, it reflects the effectiveness in controlling the operating costs.

**Pretax margin** is the margin of profit after interest payments are made, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Pretax\,margin = \frac{EBT}{Revenue}}$$
Since the taxes can be out of the management's control, it is a better measure for evaluating the **management's performance**.

**Net profit margin** is the margin of profit after taxes are made, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = \frac{Net\,income}{Revenue}}$$
The net profit margin usually adjusted for non-recurring items, it can be a better reflection of future's profitability.

### Overview of all the profitability ratios calculated from income statement:
![[Screenshot 2022-11-01 at 13.40.58.png]]

There are 5 profitability ratios calculated from **income statement** to **balance sheet** to measure against **assets, equity, and capital**:
- Return on assets (ROA)
- Operating ROA
- Return on equity (ROE)
- Return on common equity
- Return on total capital

**Return on asset (ROA)** is the earning financed by the company's total asset, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROA = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,assets}}$$
where **net income** returned back to the equity holder and **average total assets** are financed by both debt and equity holders, interest paid to the debt holders are already subtracted from net income.

Some analyst would like to add the interest paid back to the equation, therefore it is required to add the tax back on the interest:
$$\mathrm{ROA = \frac{Net\,income+Interest\,expense(1-T)}{Avg.total\,assets}}$$
because net income is determined after taxes.

Some analyst would like to calculate the ROA prior to the taxes and interest bases, it is the **operating ROA**, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Operating\,ROA = \frac{Operating\,profit}{Avg.total\,assets}}$$
where **operating profit** can be substituted by **EBIT**. Operating profit is more likely to be recurring and should have less fluctuations as compared to net profit. Â Net profit used in ROA and ROE can include one-off items, which may not occur again. Therefore, **operating ROA** is more useful for determining future profitability of a firm.

**Return on equity (ROE)** is the earning financed by the company's total equity, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
where **equity** includes minority equity, preferred equity and common equity which can be extracted from balance sheet of 2 quarterly terms or 2 annual terms.

A variation of ROE is **return on common equity**, it is the earning financed by the company's common equity, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Return\,on\,common\,equity = \frac{Net\,income-Pref. Div.}{Avg.common\,equity}}$$
where the ratio only takes into account of **common equity**, therefore the **preferred dividends** are subtracted from the equation.

**Return on total capital** is the earning financed by the company's total capital, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Return\,on\,total\,capital= \frac{EBIT}{ST\,debt+LT\,debt+Total\,equity}}$$
where **capital** includes short-term debt, long-term debt and total equity.

## DuPont analysis
**DuPont analysis** to understand the company's account for **return on equity (ROE)** (i.e. turnover of shareholder's return) by seeing the impact of **return on asset(ROA), leverage, tax burden, interest burden, and EBIT margin** by using the original 3-part approach and the extended 5-part approach.

The original **ROE** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
The **ROE** can be broken down to a function of a company's **ROA** and its use of **financial leverage**
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,assets} \times \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROE = ROA \times Financial\,leverage}$$
where these are two ratios: **ROA** and **financial leverage** are combined together. The financial leverage is Equity multiplier; it attempts to understand the ownership weight of a company by analysing how assets have been financed. A company can improve its ROE through either improving **ROA** or **financial leverage**

If a company does not have liabilities, the **financial leverage** will equal to 1.
Therefore, the **ROE** will equal to **ROA** (i.e. $ROE = ROA$).

If a company have liabilities, the **financial leverage** will be greater than 1.
If the borrowing cost < marginal rate of investing â‡’ â†‘ ROE
If the borrowing cost > marginal rate of investing â‡’ â†“ ROE

**ROA** can be decomposed with **net profit margin** and **total asset turnover**
$$\mathrm{ROA = \frac{Net\,income}{Revenue} \times \frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,Total\,asset}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROA=Net\,profit\,margin \times\,Total\,asset\,turnover}$$
where **net profit margin** determines the profitability of a company (i.e. how much income per $ sales?) and **total asset turnover** measures the efficiency (i.e. How much revenue per $ of asset?)

Therefore, the **ROE** determined by the **financial leverage**, **total asset turnover**, **net profit margin**.

The traditional DuPont equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE=\frac{Net\,income}{Revenue}\times\frac{Revenue}{Asset}\times\frac{Asset}{Equity}}$$

>**DuPont 3-way decomposition**
>In the latest financial year, Wendom Corp had a net profit margin of 0.3. Â The average total assets for the year was $1.5 million, and average total equity for the year was $0.5 million. Â The total asset turnover was 2.2.
>The ROE for Wendom for the year is closest to:
>ROE = Net profit margin x Total Asset Turnover x Leverage = 0.3 x 2.2 x 1.5/0.5 = 1.98

**Net profit margin** can be further decomposed to **tax burden**, **interest burden**, and **EBIT margin**
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = \frac{Net\,income}{EBT} \times \frac{EBT}{EBIT} \times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}}$$
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = Tax\,burden \times Interest\,burden \times EBIT\,margin}$$

**Tax burden** is the 1- avg. tax rate 
- e.g. 30% average tax rate â‡’ tax burden 0.7.
- â†‘ tax burden â‡’ keep a higher % of pretax profits

**Interest burden** captures the effect of interest
- Higher borrowing cost â‡’ lower interest burden

**EBIT margin** measures the operating profitability, the value infers the performance of sales and COGS
- Firms with a higher profitability â‡’ higher EBIT margin

Therefore, the full equation of **DuPont Analysis** is,
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,assets} \times \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg.total\,equity}\times\frac{Net\,income}{EBT} \times \frac{EBT}{EBIT} \times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROE = ROA \times Financial\,leverage \times Tax\,burden \times Interest\,burden \times EBIT\,margin}$$
**Note:** Average total should use the beginning of the balance sheet and ending of balance sheet, where as the rest can use the period of the income statement

**Note:** A company recently reduced its debt by redeeming some of its outstanding bonds.  All else equal, what is the most likely effect on the firmâ€™s ROE? A reduction in debt using cash reduces total assets; ROE = Net income/Average total Asset Â  x Â  Average total Asset/ Average Total Equity; Avg total asset decreases by same amount in both numerator and denominator. **ROE will remain constant.**

## Valuation ratios
**Valuation ratios** measure the quantity of asset or flow associated with an ownership claim

## Equity analysis
**Equity analysis** evaluate a company's performance and valuing its equity as an investment

There are few methods to value the equity:
- Valuation ratios
- Discounted cash flow
- Residual Income

### Valuation ratios
There are 4 valuation ratios (which all of it uses price):
- P/E ratio
- P/CF ratio
- P/S ratio
- P/B ratio

The **P/E ratio (Price-to-earnings ratio)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{P/E\,ratio=\frac{Price\,per\,share}{Earning\,per\,share}}$$
$$\mathrm{Basic\,EPS = \frac{Net\,Income - Preferred \,dividends}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$

Since **net income** can be subjected to manipulation on income statement, some analyst prefer to use **P/CF ratio (price-to-cash flow ratio)**.

The **P/CF ratio (price-to-cash flow ratio)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{P/CF\,ratio=\frac{Price\,per\,share}{CF\,per\,share}}$$
where CF: cash flow.
The drawbacks of these ratios are not useful when the earnings or cash flow is **negative**.

Therefore analyst can use **P/S ratio (price-to-sales ratio)**, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{P/S\,ratio=\frac{Price\,per\,share}{Sales\,per\,share}}$$
Also, it can be evaluated by the **P/B ratio (price-to-book ratio)**.
$$\mathrm{P/B\,ratio=\frac{Price\,per\,share}{Book\,value\,per\,share}}$$
$$\mathrm{BVPS = \frac{Total\,shareholder\,equity - Preferred \,equity}{Total\,number\,of\,outstanding\,shares}}$$
where BVPS: Book value per share.
It is often used as a ratio to determined the company's required rate of return vs. the actual rate of return.

Assume that under the fair valuation of a company:
- P/B = 1 â‡’ Future growth = Required market returns
- P/B > 1 â‡’ Future growth > Required market returns
- P/B < 1 â‡’ Company not expected to earn excess returns

### Per-share quantities
There are 5 ways to calculate the per-share quantities:
- Basic EPS
- Diluted EPS
- Cash flow (CF) per share
- EBITDA (*Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation*) per share
- Dividends per share

A recap on the **basic EPS** and **diluted EPS**:
$$\mathrm{Basic\,EPS = \frac{Net\,Income - Preferred \,dividends}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
$$\mathrm{Diluted\,EPS = \frac{Adjusted\,income\,available\,for\,ordinary \,shares}{Weighted\, avg.\,number\,of\,ordinary\,\&\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
The diluted securities include convertible debt, convertible preferred stocks, options, and warrants issued by the company.

The **CF per share** is equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{CF\,per\,share = \frac{CFO}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,shares\,outstanding}}$$

The **EBITDA per share** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{EBITA\,per\,share = \frac{EBITDA}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,shares\,outstanding}}$$

- The **Dividends per share** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Dividends\,per\,share = \frac{Common\,dividends\,declared}{Weighted\, average\,number\,of\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
**Note:** Basic EPS, Diluted EPS and dividends per share are only attributed to common shareholders, therefore the denominator should only include **common shares outstanding**.

### Dividend-related quantities
There are 3 **dividend-related quantities** that can be calculated:
- Dividend payout ratio
- Retention rate
- Sustainable growth rate

The **dividend payout ratio** is:
$$\mathrm{Dividends\,payout\,ratio = \frac{Common\,share\,dividends}{Net\,income\,available\,to\,common\,shares}}$$
where the common share dividends are usually quite fixed, and the net income available to common shares varies due to the business cycle â‡’ The ratio tends to fluctuate with earnings, the dividend payout policies should be evaluated over a number of periods. 

The **retention rate** is the proportion of earnings that the company retains and have the potential to grow the company, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Retention\,rate =1-Dividends\,payout\,ratio}$$

The **sustainable growth rate** is the profitability and the proportion of earnings retained that can grow the company, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Sustainable\,growth\,rate =ROE\times Retention\,rate}$$
where ROE (Return on equity) is a measure of profitability, it can be viewed as how fast a firm can grow without additional capital from external sources.

### Industry-specific ratios
For every industry, there are some **industry-specific ratios** to evaluate the performance of the company. Some analyst come up with various types of ratios to compare between companies within the same industry, particularly useful when some companies are in their start-up stage or when cash flow is not stable (i.e. EBITDA and EBIT cannot be a great measure of their profitability or performance due to negative income mostly in startups).

In this section, explore some of the industry specific ratios:
- retail sector ratios
- service sector ratios
- financial sector ratios

For retail industry, there are several **retail sector ratios**, such as: 
- Growth in same-store sales
- Sales per square foot

**Growth in same-store sales** is the $$\mathrm{Avg.\,revenue\,growth\,for\,stores\,open\,in\,both\,periods}$$, it distinguishes between growth that results from opening new stores, and growth that results from generating more sales at existing stores.

**Sales per square foot** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Sales\,per\,sq.ft.=\frac{Revenue}{Total\,retail\,space}}$$

For the service industry, there are also few **services sector ratios**:
- Revenue per employee
- Net income per employee

**Revenue per employee** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Revenue\,per\,employee=\frac{Revenue}{Total\,num.\,of\,employees}}$$

**Net income per employee** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Net\,income\,per\,employee=\frac{Net\,income}{Total\,num.\,of\,employees}}$$

For the financial industry, some **financial sector ratios**:
- Capital adequacy
- Cash reserve ratio
- Liquid asset ratio
- Net interest margin

**Capital adequacy** refers to the measure of a bank's financial strength and ability to absorb potential losses. The purpose of capital adequacy requirements is to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to cover potential losses and maintain financial stability. The equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Capital\,adequacy=\frac{Some\,component\,of\,capital}{Some\,dollar\,measure\,of\,risk}}$$
**Cash reserve ratio** is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to regulate the amount of cash commercial banks must maintain as a percentage of their total deposits. The **cash reserve ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,reserve\,ratio=\frac{Reserves\,held\,at\,central\,bank}{Specified\,deposit\,liabilities}}$$

**Liquid asset ratio** is also known as the liquidity ratio, is a measure of a bank's ability to meet short-term obligations. The **liquid asset ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Liquid\,asset\,ratio=\frac{Approved\,readily\,marketable\,securities}{Specified\,deposit\,liabilities}}$$

**Net interest margin** is a measure of a bank's profitability and represents the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expenses incurred on deposits and borrowings. The **net interest margin** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Net\,interest\,margin=\frac{Net\,interest\,income}{Total\,interest\,earning\,assets}}$$

## Credit analysis
**Credit analysis** is the assessment of a company's ability to service and repay its debt and it will be discussed in details in reading 44 - Fundamentals of credit analysis.

There are 4 ratios that can be used to evaluate the company's credit level:
- Interest coverage ratio
- Return on capital ratio
- Debt-to-assets ratio
- Cash flow to total debt ratio

The **interest coverage ratio** measures how comfortably a company can pay its interest obligations, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage\,ratio=\frac{EBIT\,or\,EBITDA\,or\,FFO}{Gross\,interest}}$$
where FFO: net income adjusted for non-cash items

The **return on capital ratio**, measures the profitability of a company, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Return\,on\,capital\,ratio=\frac{EBIT}{Average\,capital}}$$

The **debt-to-assets ratio** measures the solvency of the company, the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,to\,assets\,ratio=\frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,assets}}$$
where the smaller ratios â‡’ higher ability to meet debt obligations.

The **cash flow to total debt ratio** equation is generally as follow:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,flow\,to\,total\,debt\,ratios=\frac{Some\,measure\,of\,cash\,flow}{Total\,debt}}$$

## Segment reporting
**Conglomerate** is a multi-industry company â€“ i.e., a combination of multiple business entities operating in entirely different industries under one corporate group, usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries. Conglomerates are often large and multinational.

It is often incomparable between two conglomerate because the sectors that they're involved in are often different from one to another.

Both US GAAP and IFRS require companies to report segment data

**Business segment** definition:
- Accounts for more than 10% of the parent company's revenues or assets
- Distinguishable from the company's other lines (has risk and return characteristics that are distinguishable from those of the company's other lines of business)

**Geographic segment** defintion:
- Accounts for more than 10% of the parent company's revenues or assets
- Has a business environment that is different from that of other segments of the company's business

They must report the segments under limited financial statement information:
- Segment revenue (both internal and external)
- Segment depreciation and amortisation
- Segment operating income
- Segment assets
- Segment liabilities (IFRS only)
- Segment capital expenditure (*CAPEX*)

Based on these segment information, a variety of useful ratios can be computed:
- **Segment margin** - Profitability
- **Segment ROA** - Profitability
- **Segment turnover** - Activity
- **Segment debt ratio** - Solvency

**Segment margin** is a measure of profitability that assesses the profitability of a specific business segment or division within a company. The **segment margin** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Segment\,margin=\frac{Segment\,profit}{Segment\,revenue}}$$

**Segment ROA (return on assets)** is a profitability ratio that measures the return generated by a specific business segment relative to its assets. The equation of **segment ROA (return on assets)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Segment\,ROA=\frac{Segment\,profit}{Segment\,assets}}$$

**Segment turnover** is an activity ratio that measures the efficiency with which a specific business segment utilizes its assets to generate sales. The equation of **segment turnover** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Segment\,margin=\frac{Segment\,revenue}{Segment\,assets}}$$

**Segment debt ratio** can measure the solvency of the segment to assesses the proportion of debt financing used by a specific business segment relative to its total assets, **which is only required under IFRS**, the **segment debt ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Segment\,debt\,ratio=\frac{Segment\,liabilities}{Segment\,assets}}$$

## Forecasting models
Common analytical tools to examine financial statements:
- Common-size analysis
- Graphical analysis
- Regression analysis
- Ratio analysis

Financial ratios and common-size statements are then feed in with other information to formulate a model â‡’ Forecast future performance

Such information can be:
- Assumptions + judgement from the analyst
- Economic and Industry data

The future performance can be presented in pro-forma **financial statement**, forecast should involve in a range of possibilities (point estimate with ranges) - bullish, bearish, neutral scenarios.

The model can have:
- **Sensitivity analysis** - develops a range of possible outcomes as specific inputs are changed one at a time and it is based on "what-ifs" (e.g. "What if the cost increase by 5% rather than the estimated 3%?")
- **Scenario analysis** - is based on a specific set of outcomes for multiple variables and based on certain types of scenarios (e.g. loss of a key customer, or a catastrophic event)
- **Simulation** - based on developing probability distributions of key variables (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation)
