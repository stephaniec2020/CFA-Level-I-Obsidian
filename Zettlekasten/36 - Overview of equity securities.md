## Types of equity investments
### Introduction to equity investments
Company finance their operation through:
- **Debt** - contractually obligated to repay the principle  + interest borrowed to debt holders
- **Equity** - residual claim on the company's assets after all liabilities have been paid.

There are 2 types of shares:
- **Common shares**/**Ordinary shares**/**Common stock** - no obligation to pay dividends; have voting rights to the board of directors, merger decisions, auditor selection (have proxy voting)
- **Preferred share/Preferred stock**

Some of the common stocks can be:
- **Callable**
	- Callable common shares give the **firm/issuer** the **right to repurchase** the stock at a **pre-specified call price**; which allow firms to repurchase when market price > call price; to repurchase shares at call price
	- Lower issue price
	- Firms issue them if they want the flexibility to repurchase at at fixed price
- **Putable**
	- Putable common shares give the **shareholder** **the right to sell the shares** back to the firm at a pre-specified put price; the put option benefits the shareholder because it effectively **places a floor under the share value** as the shareholder can redeem the shares at the price if the market price goes below it.
	- Higher issue price
	- Firms issue them if they want to raise more capital

### Voting system for board of directors
There are 2 types of voting system when voting for board of directors:
- **Statutory voting system** - each share held is assigned one vote in the election of **each** board member
- **Cumulative voting system** -  shareholders are allowed to **accumulate** their votes to **cast on any candidate** they wish

### Classes of common stockholders:
There maybe **different classes** (class A, class B) of common shares, which give different treatment to shareholders:
- Voting power
- Higher seniority in case of liquidation
- Different treatment with respect to dividends and stock splits

Shareholders have to refer to company's filings with securities regulators.

### Preference share
**Preference share** have features of both common stock and debt:
- **No voting rights** 
- **Fixed periodic payments**
- **Do not mature**
- **Can have put/call options**
- **Dividends not an obligation** (can be **cumulative** or **non-cumulative**)
	- a stated par value and pay a percentage dividend based on the par value of the shares
	- firm is only required to ensure that preferred dividends has priority over common stock dividends and no dividends unless preferred stockholders have been fully paid
	- **non-cumulative** - no recourse but to accept lesser or no dividends for the year
	- **cumulative** - no recourse but to accept lesser or no dividends for the year, but shortfall is accumulated to be repaid in the future
- **Participating/non-participating** - in the event of liquidation, non-participating preference share = par value; participating preference shares provide more upside to investors, have extra dividends if profits>predetermined level, and liquidation maybe > par value.
- **Convertible preference share** - allows preference shares to be exchanged for common shares at a conversion ratio determined when the shares are issued; mostly are venture capital and private equity due to limited risk when firm is not profitable yet and participate in the upside when the firm turns profitable
	- Preferred dividend > common dividend
	- If firm is profitable, investors can share in profits by converting to common stock
	- When common stock price increases, conversion options becomes more valuable
	- Less risky than common stock as there are stable dividend and seniority in event of liquidation

## Private vs. public equity securities
### Private vs. public equity securities
Companies can issue shares through **public** or **private**: 
- **Publicly traded equity**, which companies issue through IPOs and are traded in public exchanges.
- **Private equity** - usually issued to institutional investors via private placements
	- no active secondary market
	- highly illiquid
	- traded through negotiations
	- limited financial disclosures - lower reporting cost
	- can focus on long-term prospects
	- weaker corporate governance
	- potentially high returns when the company goes public

### Types of private equity:
The 3 main types of private equity investments are:
- **Venture Capital** 
- **Leveraged buyout (LBO)**
- **Private investments in public equity**

### Venture capital
**Venture capital** invest in companies in the early stages of their development:
- often is in the form of equity, but can be and convertible preferred shares or convertible debt.
- While the risk of failure is high, returns on successful companies can be very high (via IPO)

**Venture capital fund** is invested are referred to as its portfolio companies.
- Venture capital fund managers are closely involved in the development of portfolio companies often sitting on their boards or filling key management roles.

**Categorisation** of venture capital investments is based on the company's stage of development:
- **Angel** - transform idea into business plan typically provided by individuals
- **Seed stage financing** - product development, marketing, research, typically the stage during which venture capital funds make initial investments through ordinary or convertible preferred shares
- **Early stage financing** - initial production costs and sales expenses (i.e. before commercial production and sales)
- **Later stage financing** - expansion of production and increasing sales (e.g. operating as commercial entity)
- **Mezzanine stage financing** - to prepare for IPO for established companies

### Leveraged buyout (LBO)
**Leveraged buyout funds** acquire established private companies or publicly listed companies with a **significant % of the purchase price financed through debt**. If the target is a publicly listed company, it's taken private after the buyout, the ultimate objective of a buyout is to restructure the acquired company and profit later by taking it public again, by issuing new shares to the public.

The target firm should have the potential for increase in value through:
- Management incentives
- Restructuring
- Cost reduction
- Revenue enhancement

There are 2 types of buyouts:
- **Management buyouts** - where existing management stay to implement
- **Management buy-ins** - where the external management replace the existing management

### Private investment in public equity (PIPE)
**Private investment in public equity (PIPE)** is generally sought by a public company that's in need of additional capital quickly and willing to sell a sizeable ownership position to private investors.

The **additional capital** may be needed for:
- a significant expansion opportunity
- to pay off large amounts of debt
- to cope with a distressed situation

The private investor **may be able to purchase shares in the company at a significant discount** to the publicly quoted market price.

## Investing in non-domestic equity securities
**Integrated markets** allow capital flows freely across borders, **technological innovations** and the **growth of electronic exchanges** have accelerated the integration and growth of global financial markets.

Advantage of market integration:
- made it easier and less expensive for companies to raise capital
- investing in foreign companies allows investors to diversify their portfolios

However, barriers to global capital flows still exist.

### Restrictions on foreign investments
Many countries still **impose restrictions on foreign individuals and companies** from investing in their domestic companies.

The ways of restriction on foreign investments:
- Restrictions on foreign individuals and companies from investing in their domestic companies
- Regulation requiring domestic ownership in foreign companies

Some of the reasons behind restriction:
- Limit foreign control on domestic companies
- Reduce volatility capital flows in and out of domestic equity markets

An increasing number of countries have dropped foreign capital restrictions. Studies have shown that reducing such barriers improves equity market performance.

### Listing company's share in foreign market
Companies are increasingly turning to foreign investors for capital by **listing their stocks on foreign stock exchanges** or by **encouraging foreign ownership** of their shares, and the reason behind it:
- Increases publicity
- Increases share liquidity
- Increases firm transparency

### Ways to invest in foreign market
There are several avenues to invest in foreign market:
- **Direct investing**
- **Indirect investing** - Depository receipts (DR): global DR, American DR, basket of DRs, global registered shares

#### Direct investing
**Direct investing** is to buy and sell foreign securities in the foreign market, however there are several issues to consider:
- The investment and return are denominated in a foreign currency
- Foreign stock exchange may be less liquid.
- The reporting requirements of foreign stock exchanges may be less strict, impeding analysis.
- Regulations and procedures of each market may be different, so investors have to familiarise themselves with account opening and trading rules.

#### Indirect investing (depository receipts)
**Indirect investing** in the context of depository receipts: **Depositary Receipts (DR)** represent ownership in a foreign firm traded like **ordinary shares** in **local markets**, in **local market currencies.** There are **global** and **American** **Depositary Receipts (DR)**.

To create **Depositary Receipts (DR)**:
1. Depository bank deposit shares of a foreign firm
2. Issues depositary receipts, representing ownership of a specific number of the foreign share in the local market
3. The DR can be bought by local investors
4. The Depository Bank acts as a custodian and manages dividends, stock splits and other events

The **value of the depository receipt (DR)** is affected by:
- the price of the underlying foreign stocks
- the currency exchange rate.

There are 2 types of **Depositary Receipts (DR)**:
- **Sponsor DR** 
	- one in which the foreign firm is involved with the issue of the receipts and investor of a sponsor
	- has direct voting rights and the right to receive dividends
- **Unsponsored DR** 
	- foreign firm has no involvement in the issuance and the depository bank buys the shares from the foreign market.
	- the investor does not have any voting rights which is retained by the depository bank.

#### Global depository receipts (GDR)
**Global depositary receipts (GDR)** are:
- **issued outside the United States** and the **not in issuer's home country**.
- traded on the London or Luxembourg exchanges, although not listed on US exchanges, they are usually denominated in US dollars and can be sold to US institutional investors.
- not subject to the capital flow restrictions imposed by governments and thus offer both the foreign firm and the investor greater opportunities.
- The firm usually chooses to list the GDR in a market where many investors are familiar with the firm.

#### American depository receipts (ADR)
**American depository receipts (ADR)** are:
- denominated in US dollars
- traded in the United States
- underlying security on which the ADR is based is the American depository share, which trades in the firm's home market.

There are 4 kinds of ADRs which is summarised here:
- **Level I** - trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and are not listed on any exchange.
- **Level II** and **level III** - are both listed securities that trade in the US market.
- The main difference between the **Level II** and **level III** is that Level III can raise capital in the US market through public offerings.
- The rule 144A ADR, a securities extend to private equity and does not require SEC registration. Foreign firms are allowed to raise capital by privately placing these depository receipts with qualified institutional investors.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-19 at 15.48.32.png]]

#### Basket of listed depository receipts (BLDRs)
**Basket of listed depository receipts** is when a number of depositary receipts are pooled into a portfolio and securitised as an **exchange traded fund**, just like common stocks and any other ETFs.

#### Global registered shares 
**Global registered shares** are **common shares issued by the same company** that's traded on **different stock exchanges in different currencies**.

**The shares are identical**, just that they're **quoted and traded in different currencies**.

Such securities offer **more flexibility than depository receipts** because the shares represent an actual ownership interest in the company and currency conversions are not needed to trade in them.

## Risk and return characteristics of equity securities
### Components of equity return
There are 2 main sources of equity return:
- **Capital gains** - difference between the selling price and purchase price.
- **Dividends** received during the period.

The total return equation is:
$$\mathrm{Total\,return=\frac{(Capital\,gain+Dividends)}{Buy
\,price}}$$

For the foreign shares or depository receipts, the total return includes foreign exchange gains:
$$\mathrm{Total\,return=\frac{(Capital\,gain+Dividends)}{Buy
\,price}+Foreign\,exchange\,gains}$$

For the reinvested dividends, the total return equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,return=\frac{(Capital\,gain+Dividends+Gains\,from\,reinvested\,dividends)}{Buy
\,price}}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-05-19 at 15.56.21.png]]

### Company stage and expected return
**Growth stocks** are companies that are **in the early stages** of their life cycle generally pay little or no dividends because earnings and cash flows are reinvested to finance the company's growth, rather. Investors expect higher capital gains from such stocks.

In contrast, **value stocks** are companies that are in the **mature phase** tend to pay higher dividends as they may not have much opportunities to invest the excess cash flow. Consequently, investors may not have high expectations on the growth in stock price but instead dividends.

### Estimating equity returns and risks
**Risk** is often measured by calculating the standard deviation of the equities expected total return. The **risk of an equity** security can be defined as the **uncertainty of its future total return**.
One way to estimate return and risk:
- use the **average historical return of the stock** as a proxy for its future return 
- the historical standard deviation of returns as proxy for its expected risk.

Another method involves:
- estimating a range of future returns over a specified period of time, assigning probabilities to those returns
- calculating an expected return
- a standard deviation of return

### Risk and return of different equity instruments
There are 2 types of shares:
- **Common shares**/**Ordinary shares**/**Common stock** - which can be callable/putable
- **Preferred share/Preferred stock** - which can be cumulative or non-cumulative, can have callable/putable
For both common and preferred shares, putable shares are less risky than shares with no embedded options, which are less risky than callable shares.

#### Risk and return of preference share
**Preference share**:
- dividends are known and fixed, which is large portion of the total return
- receive dividends before common shareholders
- par value owed to preference shareholders in event of liquidation
The risk is less compare to common stock due to these factors.

#### Risk and return of common shares
With **common shares**:
- a larger portion of the total return is based on future price appreciation
- future dividends are unknown
- have a lower priority if the company is liquidated

#### Risk and return of putable shares
**Putable shares**:
- the least risky because if the market price drops, the investor can put the shares back to the firm at a fixed price.
- This fixed price establishes a floor on the price for investors and reduces the uncertainty with future capital gains
- Putable shares usually pay a lower dividend yield than non-putable shares.

#### Risk and return of callable shares
Callable shares:
- the most risky because if the market price rises, the firm can call the shares.
- This limits the upside potential of the shares, callable shares, therefore, usually have higher dividend yields than non callable shares.

## Equity securities and company value
### Role of equity 
Companies issue equity:
- **to raise capital to finance their business activities**
	- e.g. purchase long lived assets, finance research and development, enter into new products or market and acquire other companies.
- **continues to operate as a going concern (ensure continuing operations)**
	- e.g. fulfill regulatory requirements, improve capital adequacy ratios, to comply with the debt covenants
- **increase the firm's liquidity**
	- e.g. provide the firm with currency that can be used to acquire other companies without using cash, provide stock option based incentives to employees.

The ultimate goal of all these activities by the firm's management is to **increase net income** of the firm, which in turn may **increase the wealth of the various shareholders**.

### Market vs book value
#### Book value of equity
Increasing that income has the effect of **increasing retained earnings** on the **firm's balance sheet**, which **increases the book value of equity of the firm**.

The **book value of equity** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Book\,value\,of\,equity=Assets-Liabilities}$$
The more net income that is earned and retained, the greater is the book value of equity. Management's decisions directly influence the company's net income, they also directly influence its book value of equity. The book value of equity **can be seen as a reflection of a firm's past and present performance**.

#### Market value of equity
The **market value of equity** is the total value of a firm's outstanding equity shares based on market prices.

The **market value of equity** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Market\,value\,of\,equity=\#\,of\,outstanding\,shares\times Market\,price}$$
Investors determine the market price based on their perceptions of the firm's **risk and the expectations of future cash flows**. The market value of equity **reflects the market's consensus view of the firm's future performance**.

#### Price-to-book ratio
The **price-to-book (PB) ratio** is the market value of a firm's equity, divided by the book value of its equity. The equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{PB\,ratio=\frac{Market\,value\,of\,equity}{Book\,value\,of\,equity}}$$

The PB ratio can be seen as a measure of investor confidence of a firm's future performance. High PB ratio reflects strong optimism in future growth.

Interestingly, the book value and market value of equity are seldom close to equal.

Although management may be accomplishing its objective of increasing book value of equity, this increase may not be reflected in the market value as it does not affect investors expectations about the company's future cash flows.

### Accounting ROE
As such, the market value of equity of a firm is not a fair measure of a management's past performance. **Accounting return on equity (ROE)** is a measure of effectiveness of management in increasing the company's book value.

The **accounting ROE** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE=\frac{Net\,income}{Average\,book\,value}}$$
$$\mathrm{=\frac{Net\,income-Preferred\,dividend}{(BV_{t-1}+BV_t)/2}}$$
where BV: book value. It is appropriate when it is the industry convention and when the book value is volatile.

or only beginning period is used:
$$\mathrm{=\frac{Net\,income-Preferred\,dividend}{BV_{t-1}}}$$
where BV: book value. It is appropriate when examining ROE over periods and when the book value is stable.

A **high ROE is generally a favourable reflection of a firm's effectiveness**, however, an analyst should examine the reason for an increase.

There are certain caveats to look out for:
- an increase in ROE can be due to book value decreasing at a faster rate than net income
- issue debt to repurchase equity, thereby decreasing the book value of equity, making the firm shares riskier due to the increased debt.

### Cost of equity
When a company issues securities, there's a cost associated with a capital that is raised. If it's debt securities, **cost of debt** is easily estimated based on the **interest obligation**. The **cost of equity** is much harder to estimate.

Investors has a **minimum required rate of return** on the funds they provide the company as compensation for undertaking the risk as it is based on the future cash flows they expect to receive, which are **unknown and uncertain**. 

The **expected rate of return of a stock is inversely related to the stock price**. When the stock price goes up, it's expected rate of return goes down. If the expected rate of return is lower than investors minimum required rate of return, investors will sell the shares, sending the price down and the expected rate of return up. This goes on until the equilibrium, which is the investors minimum required rate of return.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 21.16.25.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 21.16.44.png]]

For attracting risk averse investors to buy **new equity** from the company, it has to minimally match the investors **minimum required rate of return**.

The company's cost of equity is equal to the investors minimum required rate of return (i.e. **cost of equity** = investors required return).

Two models commonly used to estimate a company's cost of equity or investors minimum required rate of return are the **dividend discount model** and the **capital asset pricing model.**
