## Own-price elasticity of demand
### Equation of elasticity of demand
**Own-price elasticity of demand** is is the percentage change in quantity demanded when the price changes by 1%. It's important to understand that **elasticity $\ne$ the slope of a demand curve**. This is because elasticity is based on percentage changes while the graph is based on absolute values.

The **own-price elasticity of demand** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{E_demand=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}}$$
where $\mathrm{E_{demand}}$: own-price elasticity; $\mathrm{\%\Delta Q}$: change in quantity demanded; $\mathrm{\%\Delta P}$: change in price. When the demand curve is downward sloping, the own-price elasticity is $\mathrm{E_{demand}}$ < 0.

There are 4 major types of elasticity of demand:
- **Elastic demand**
- **Perfectly elastic demand**
- **Inelastic demand**
- **Perfectly inelastic demand**

### Elastic demand
When the quantity demanded is very responsive to a change in price, we say the **demand is elastic**. The absolute value of elasticity > 1 (i.e. |$\mathrm{E_{demand}}$| > 1).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.14.33.png]]

### Perfectly elastic demand
An extreme theoretical example is when the demand curve is fully horizontal. We call this perfectly elastic demand where the elasticity is infinite. The absolute value of elasticity =  $\infty$ (i.e. |$\mathrm{E_{demand}}$| = $\infty$).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.19.10.png]]

### Inelastic demand
In contrast, when the quantity demanded is not very responsive to a change in price, we say that demand is inelastic. The absolute value of elasticity is < 1 (i.e.  |$\mathrm{E_{demand}}$| < 1).

e.g., if a pharmaceutical drug has hardly any close substitutes, the demand for it will just drop a little even when the manufacturer increases price by a lot. Consumers have no choice as the drug is necessary to maintain their health.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.20.10.png]]

### Perfectly inelastic demand
An extreme example is when the demand curve is fully vertical. We call this perfectly inelastic demand where the elasticity = 0 (i.e. |$\mathrm{E_{demand}}$| = 0).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.22.37.png]]

### Elasticity coefficient, demand function, and demand curve
If we decompose the formula, we get it in this form:
$$\mathrm{E_demand=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}=\frac{\Delta Q/Q_0}{\Delta P/P_0}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\frac{P_0}{Q_0}}$$

This term, the ratio of change in price to change in quantity is known as the **elasticity coefficient (C)** and is also the **slope** of the demand function.

The **elasticity coefficient (C)** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{C=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}}$$

The **demand function** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Q=j+CP}$$
where C: elasticity coefficient

**Note that the demand function is not the demand curve**. However, rearrange the terms to get the equation for the demand curve, the **demand curve** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{P=k+(\frac{1}{C})Q}$$

So here we can see that the **slope of the curve is the reciprocal of the elasticity coefficient (1/C)**, which is the change in price divided by the change in quantity demanded (i.e. ${\Delta P}$/${\Delta Q}$). 

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.25.28.png]]

e.g. If the **demand curve** for apples is -0.5, we can rearrange the equation to get the **demand function** for apples. The **demand elasticity coefficient of apples is -2**, which means that the **price elasticity of demand** for apples is as such (i.e. E=(-2)$P_0$/$Q_0$).
![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.15.56.png]]

### Unitary elasticity point
**The function for elasticity is not constant**, it very much depends on which point of the curve being examined.

e.g. At a high price of $10, the quantity demanded will be 10 units, the price elasticity here is -2. At a low price of $5, the quantity demanded will be 20 units and the price elasticity here is -0.5.

For a downward sloping demand curve, there's this **unitary elasticity point** where unique point **where the elasticity is -1**. **Note that the total revenue is maximised at this point.**

Also, **unitary elasticity point** is the dividing point between the **elastic region and inelastic region** of the demand curve.

An increase in price moves us to the **elastic region of the curve**, where the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage increase in price, resulting in a decrease in total revenue. (i.e. â†“â†“$\%\Delta Q$ / â†‘ $\%\Delta P$ )

A decrease in price from this point moves us into the inelastic region, where the percentage increase in quantity demanded is less than the percentage decrease in price, resulting again in a decrease in total revenue.  (i.e. â†‘$\%\Delta Q$ / â†“â†“ $\%\Delta P$ )

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.27.48.png]]

e.g.The demand function for E scooters is as follows. Calculate the own price elasticity of demand for scooters at a price of 500 dollars and state where the demand is elastic or inelastic at this price point.
![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.25.22.png]]

>The demand curve for luxury mattresses is P=12000-20Q.
>The own-price elasticity of demand for luxury mattresses at a price point of $8000 is: **Elastic** 
>P=12000-20Q  -> Q=600-0.05**P
>At $8000, Q=600-0.05Ã—8000=200
>E=(**-0.05) x P/Q  =-0.05 x 8000/200  = -2.0 (elastic as |-2.0|>1)

### Factors that affect own-price elasticity of demand
There are several factors that will affect the own-price elasticity of demand:
- **Availability of close substitutes** - 
- **Portion of income spent on the good**
- **Time period since price change** - consumers take time to adjust consumption habits
- **Necessity of products** - 

![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.29.28.png]]

## Cross-price and income elasticity of demand
**Own price elasticity of demand**, when a goods own price increases, the quantity demanded is reduced, resulting in a downward sloping demand curve.

**The demand function**, which states the quantity demanded based on one single variable
that is the own price of the good itself. The **demand function** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Q=j+C_{own}P_{own}}$$
where $C_{own}$: elasticity coefficient of own price, $P_{own}$: own price.

The coefficient can be applied to the formula for the own price elasticity of demand, which is the percentage change in quantity for every percentage, change in own price. If we decompose the **own price elasticity of demand formula**, we get it in this form:
$$\mathrm{E_{own}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P_{own}}=C_own\frac{P_{own0}}{Q_0}}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.29.21.png]]

### The demand function 
The demand function can be expressed by adding a 2nd independent variable, that is **the price of related goods** and a 3rd variable, **the income level of consumers**.

The full **demand function** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Q=j+c_own P_own+c_rel P_rel+ c_inc I}$$
where $\mathrm{c_{own} P_{own}}$: own price; $\mathrm{c_{rel} P_{rel}}$: price of related good; $\mathrm{c_{inc} I}$: Income level of consumers.

The **own-price elasticity of demand** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{E_{own}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P_{own}}=C_own\frac{P_{own0}}{Q_0}}$$
where $C_{own}$: elasticity coefficient of own price, $P_{own}$: own price.

The **cross-price elasticity of demand** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{E_{cross}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P_{rel}}=C_rel\frac{P_{rel0}}{Q_0}}$$
where $C_{rel}$: elasticity coefficient of relative good price, $P_{rel}$: related good price; which is the percentage change in quantity demanded for every percentage change in price of the related good.

The **income elasticity of demand** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{E_{inc}=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta I}=C_inc\frac{I_0}{Q_0}}$$
where:  $C_{inc}$: elasticity coefficient of income level of consumers, $I_0$: consumer income; which is the percentage change in quantity, demanded for every percentage change in income level.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 19.29.33.png]]

### Cross price of related good
There are several types of related goods:
- **Substitutes**
- **Complements**

#### Substitutes cross price 
When the **price** of a **substitute** **increases the demand for the good increases** and vice versa. Since there is a direct relationship between the two, the cross price elasticity is therefore positive (i.e. $E_{cross}$ > 0) when the related good is a substitute.

e.g., ride hailing services like Uber can be considered a substitute to buying a personal car when the price of Uber rides is lowered, the sales of private cars may be lowered as consumers switch to taking Uber rides.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 23.48.55.png]]

#### Complement cross price 
**Complements**, which has the **opposite effect of substitutes**. Since there is an inverse relationship between the two cross prices (i.e. $E_{cross}$ < 0), price elasticity is therefore negative when the related good is a compliment.

e.g., gasoline can be seen as a complement to cars if the price of gasoline decreases, the demand for cars may increase as it lowers the cost for private transport. Likewise, when the price of gasoline increases, the demand for cars may decrease as commuters give up driving and turn to public transport.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 23.49.11.png]]

Overall, the more positive the cross price elasticity is, the stronger the substitutionary relationship. Likewise, the more negative the cross price elasticity, the stronger the complimentary relationship.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 23.49.22.png]]

### Income elasticity of demand
When a consumer's income increases, he's able to purchase more. However, this doesn't mean necessarily that the demand of any good will increase. It depends very much on the type of good.
There are broadly 2 types of goods:
- **Normal goods**
- **Inferior goods**

#### Normal goods and income elasticity of demand
**Normal goods** are those goods in which the demand increases with consumer income levels increases and vice versa. When people feel richer, they may feel more justified to indulge in branded clothes, fine dining and fancy cars. Since there is a **direct relationship** between the two, the income elasticity is therefore positive for normal goods (i.e. $E_{inc} > 0$).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 23.49.37.png]]

#### Inferior goods and income elasticity of demand
**Inferior goods** are those for which the demand decreases with consumer income levels decreases. When recession hits, income levels go down and consumers may turn to budget clothes, fast food and budget cars. Since there is an **inverse relationship** between the two, the income elasticity is therefore negative for inferior goods (i.e. $E_{inc} < 0$).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 23.49.51.png]]

e.g. Let's say an average low income American family has the following demand function for a Big Mac at McDonald's based on its own price across the price of a whopper at Burger King, across price of French fries in McDonald's and the income level of the family.

Just from the **signs of the coefficients** of the various factors, we can deduce that the whopper is a substitute good, French fries are a complimentary good, and because the coefficient of the income level is positive, Big Macs are considered normal goods to a low income family.
![[Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 00.01.10.png]]

![[Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 00.04.06.png]]

If you were McDonald's, which are these four factors, would you be most concerned about if you want to target the low income? 

If you observe only the own price elasticity of demand is elastic as the absolute value is greater than one. The rest of the elasticities are inelastic because their absolute value is lower than one. This means that the demand of Big Macs from the low income is the most sensitive to the price of the Big Mac itself.

So if McDonald's wants to target low income families, the most effective approach would be to lower the price of the Big Mac itself or give special discount coupons to the low income.

## Substitution and income effects
The law of demand states that when the price of a good falls and all else is equal, the demand for the good increases. According to this law, the demand curve for any good is downward sloping.

We can understand the quantity demanded through attributing to these 2 effects:
- **The substitution effect** - effect where consumers always have a greater consumption of the good that has fallen in price
- **The income effect** - does not refer to the income of the family, but rather the **change in real income**, which refers to **purchasing power**

### Types of goods and quantity demanded
So what determines whether the income effect for a good is positive or negative? It depends on whether the good is a **normal good** or **inferior good**.  If the good is a normal good, the income effect will be positive. If the good is an inferior good, the income effect will be negative.

### Summary of quantity demanded when price decrease
In summary, there are three possible outcomes when the price of a good decreases.
1. If the substitution effect and income effect are both positive, the consumption of the good will increase.
2. If the substitution effect is positive, but the negative income effect < substitution effect, the consumption of the good will also increase.
3. If the negative income effect > the substitution effect. In this case, the net consumption of the good will decrease.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.55.06.png]]

### Giffen good
**Giffen good** is an inferior good for which the negative income effect outweighs the positive substitution effect when price falls. When the price goes down, the demand goes down.
This is an exception to the law of demand. Although Giffen good is only in theory, there are some rare instances where this has turned out to be true.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.56.40.png]]

### Veblen good
Another exception where the demand curve is upward sloping is the **Veblen good**:
- Higher price makes the good more desirable
- Luxury goods (e.g. Hermes bags) 
- Higher price conveys higher status
- only applies to a select group of people
- Limit to how high price can go

![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 17.57.33.png]]

## Marginal returns and productivity
### Factors of production
In order to run a business, several inputs are needed to make that happen. In economic terms, we call these inputs the **factors of production**, which can include:
- **Land** - which in this case is the physical space you own or rent.
- **Labour (L)** - all workers that you hire from unskilled to top management.
- **Physical capital (Plant & Equipment) (k)** - Any equipments required to make the good/service; Note that this does not include financial capital.
- **Materials** -  inputs that make the production possible

### Short run vs long run
Economics perspective of **short run** versus **long run**:
- **Short run** - to the time period over which **some factors of production are fixed** â‡’ **capital is fixed** in the short run and takes time to change its scale of operations. (e.g. leases are fixed and need to be fulfilled,  physical expansion of operations) 
- **Long run** - all factors of production are variable â‡’ (e.g. leases expire and sell its equipment, raise new financial capital to expand operations)

e.g. cafe shop
![[Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 18.05.45.png]]

There are several measurements of productivity:
- **Total production** - quantity of coffee served
- **Average production** - quantity of coffee served per labour unit
- **Marginal production** - change in quantity of coffee served/change in quantity of labour

### Total production
**Total production** is simply the total output in a period and the total production should be a function of the labor and capital input.

The equation of **total production function** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Q=f(L,K)}$$
where Q: quantity produced; L: Labour; K: physical capital.

**In the short run**, we assume that capital (K) is fixed as it's hard to expand given the constraints of the space and funding (e.g. the number of tables, chairs, coffee machines and kitchen equipment in the cafe is fixed). The quantity of labor is the only variable that affects the total production in the short run.

### Average production output
**Average production** is the **total output per unit of input**.

The equation of **average product output function** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{AP=\frac{Q}{L}}$$
where AP: average production; Q: quantity produced; L: Labour.

### Marginal product 
**Marginal product** is the amount of **additional product resulting from using one more unit of input**.

The equation of **marginal product** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{MP=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}}$$
where MP: marginal production; Q: quantity produced; L: Labour.

### Marginal productivity of labour
**Marginal productivity of labour** describes the phenomenon ofÂ diminishing marginal productivity of labor, where in the short run, the additional output from each additional worker decreases progressively.

e.g. When you don't hire any workers, there's unlikely to be any coffee served.

When you hire just one employee for a start, this employees overwhelmed by taking all three rolls of cooking, serving and cleaning. The production suffers on the cafe, can only serve 20 cups of coffee a day.

If you employ a second employee, productivity is improved, the cafe serves 50 cups a day and the average product increases to 25 cups per employee. The marginal product is 30 cups because the output has increased by 30 cups from hiring one additional employee.

If you employ a third employee, productivity is improved further as each employee has their specialized role. The cafe serves 90 cups a day and the average product is now 30 cups per employee and the marginal product is 40 cups. So far, you should be quite pleased as hiring more employees has been improving productivity with the average product and marginal product both increasing. 

However, if you hire the fourth, fifth and sixth employees, you'll find that the increase in output starts to slow. This means that the benefit from hiring gets progressively less as can be seen by the declining average product and marginal product.

And when you add the seventh employee, you may find that the output remains the same. So marginal product is 0. This may be due to the cafe reaching its **maximum capacity**. In some cases, adding even more employees may result in a drop in output, giving us a negative marginal product. This may be due to your cafe becoming so crowded with employees that productivity is reduced.

There are **three distinct stages in the analysis of marginal productivity of labor**:
- When the labor input increase, a smaller marginal productivity is increasing. The slope of the output curve increases at this stage (i.e. APâ†‘, MPâ†‘).
- When the labor input gets larger, the marginal productivity is decreasing (i.e. APâ†“, MPâ†“). The slope will the output curve decreases at this stage. 
- For some companies, marginal productivity can become zero or even negative. The output curve hits a maximum and starts to dip beyond that.

## Breakeven or shutdown analysis
With the management of business to continue operating, there are 2 major aspects should be concerned about:
- **Costs**
- **Revenue**

### Costs of business
**Costs of business** can be:
- **Fixed** - fixed costs cannot be changed in the short run.
- **Variable** - vary according to the level of production (e.g. labour)

The equation of **average fixed cost** is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,fixed\,cost=\frac{Total\,fixed\,cost}{Quantity}}$$
As the number of coffee served increases, the average fixed cost decreases if we plot the average fixed cost against the quantity produced, we get this downward sloping line.

The equation of **average variable cost** is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,variable\,cost=\frac{Total\,variable\,cost}{Quantity}}$$
Since the phenomenon of diminishing marginal productivity of labor, the average variable cost starts increasing after a certain point.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 16.50.08.png]]

The equation of **total cost** is:
$$\mathrm{Total\,cost=Total\,fixed\,cost+\,Total\,variable\,cost}$$
The equation of **average total cost** is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,total\,cost=\frac{Total\,cost}{Quantity}}$$
If we plot the ATC, it should look like the AVC shifted up by the AFC.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 16.52.40.png]]

### Marginal cost
The **marginal cost** is the **change in total cost per unit change in output quantity**. Again, it is upward sloping after a certain point due to diminishing marginal productivity.

The **marginal cost equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Marginal\,cost =\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}}$$
where TC: total cost; Q: quantity.

One interesting thing to note is that the marginal cost curve intersects the AVC and ATC curves at their minimum (i.e. MC, $\mathrm{AVC_{min}}$, $\mathrm{ATC_{min}}$). These **two minimums are important as they determine the shutdown and breakeven price** levels for the firm.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 16.53.57.png]]

### Revenue calculation
In order to calculate revenue, it is the **quantity of unit sold $\times$ price**. However, for the price estimation, the kind of competitive market the firm operates in determines the goods/services price.

#### Revenue of perfect competitive market
In a perfectly competitive market, it is a price taker and therefore it has a perfectly elastic demand curve. The marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the average revenue (AR), which is equal to the market price. (i.e. Price = MR = AR). For every additional good being sold, the MR is the same as AR.

If the good sells at the market price, the profit maximising point will be this point where the marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the marginal cost (MC) (i.e. MR = MC).

### Profit making scenario
The **average profit equation (when MR>MC)** is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,profit=Average\,revenue-Average\,total\,cost}$$

To maximize profit, a business would like to charge as high a price as the competition will allow at as high a quantity as possible. Ideally, a business would want to operate on a price quantity level as far to this top right corner as possible. The profit is maximised when you produce at Q* quantity.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 16.59.33.png]]

### Profit loss scenario
At another scenario where the market price of a good is between the ATC and AVC. The profit maximising point has moved here, but notice that at this price, the **average revenue is lower than the average total cost (i.e. AR < ATC)**. This means that the **business will run at a loss**. 

Notice that **at this price point, it's still above the AVC**. This means that for every good you serve, you're able to at least **cover the variable costs and a part of the fixed costs**. In the short run, the business should continue be running such that the loss is due to the fixed costs are minimised. After the fixed cost expires, then business make a decision on whether to close down the business.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.04.06.png]]

### Shutdown analysis
However, if the **market price drops to below both the ATC and AVC**, the business **should be shutdown immediately** because selling every additional good/service **incurs additional losses** on top of the fixed cost that have to be paid.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.04.22.png]]

So, in essence, under perfect competition, this minimum point where the ATC is equal to the MC is the breakeven level (i.e. ATC = MC â‡’ breakeven level).

If market price is above this breakeven level, your firm makes a profit. 
If market price is below this breakeven level, your firm makes a loss. However, if the loss is above AVC, the business should continue to operate in the short run as the losses from fixed costs can be minimised. The business should shut down the firm in the long run if conditions don't improve.

If the market price is below this the shutdown level (i.e. Price < both ATC and AVC), the business should be shut in both the short run and the long run.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.05.29.png]]

### Total revenue curve and profit making scenario
If the demand curve is horizontal, the **total revenue (TR) curve** will be an upward sloping straight line. A typical **total cost (TC) curve** will look something like this. If the TR > TC, there is economic profit, and the maximised profit is where the TC and TR difference is the greatest.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.06.47.png]]

### Total revenue curve and profit loss scenario
If the demand is lower such that the **total revenue (TR) curve is below the total cost (TC) curve**, **no economic profit** can be made. However, if the total revenue (TR) is still higher than the total variable cost (TVC) **(i.e. TC > TR > TVC)**, the firm **should still continue to operate in the short run, but shut down in the long run**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.06.55.png]]

### Total revenue curve and shutdown analysis
If the demand is even lower, the **total revenue cannot even cover the total variable costs** (i.e. TR < TVC), so the firm **should shut down both in the short run and in the long run**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.07.04.png]]

### Imperfect competition and profit making scenario
The demand curve for an imperfect competition firm (e.g. monopolist) is downward sloping. This **demand curve is the average revenue (AR) curve** as well (i.e. price = AR). The **marginal revenue (MR)** curve will be a steeper, downward sloping curve that can go below zero at certain levels of output.

The profit maximising outputs is where the **marginal cost (MC)** equals the **marginal revenue (MR)** (i.e. MC = MR). If the firm is actually making profit at this level of output, we check if the average revenue (AR) is higher than the average total cost (ATC) (i.e. AR > ATC).

The average profit equation (when AR>MC) is:
$$\mathrm{Average\,profit=Average\,revenue-Average\,total\,cost}$$

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 22.08.50.png]]

### Imperfect competition and breakeven scenario
If the demand is reduced such that the demand curve barely touches the ATC curve, we know that this is the **breakeven point for the firm**. Likewise, if this point goes below the ATC curve, the firm should still continue to operate in the short run if it's still above the AVC curve (i.e. AVC< Price < ATC).

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 22.09.00.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 22.09.11.png]]

### Imperfect competition and shutdown scenario
However, if the demand is so low that this point goes below the AVC curve (i.e. Price < AVC), the firm should shut down both in the short run and in the long run.

## Economies and diseconomies of scale
### Economies of scale
**Economies of scale** occur if the cost per unit of production falls as the firm increases its scale. (i.e. The business can now produce more at the same costs, , not only that, the costs may likely be lower as enjoying economies of scale effect.) 
Generally, it results from factors such as:
- labor specialisation
- mass production
- more equipment/technology
- negotiate lower input pricing as bargaining power â†‘

Therefore, business owner should expand your business for as long as there is economies of scale, as this improves the competitiveness and profitability of the business with lower costs.

Economies of scale have to hit a limit somewhere. **Constant returns to scale** is when scaling up does not result in any economies of scale. 

### Diseconomies of scale
**Diseconomies of scale** is when scaling up even further results in an **increase in average costs**.
There are several reasons for diseconomies of scale:
- Inefficiencies from bureaucracy of larger firms
- Problems with motivating a larger workforce
- Greater barriers to innovation and entrepreneurial activity

![[Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 17.16.06.png]]

### Minimum efficient scale
If we draw a line that connects all the minimum's of the **short run average total cost (ATC)** curves, we get the **long run ATC** curve of the firm.

**Minimum efficient scale** is the lowest point on the long run ATC corresponds to the scale at which the average total cost of production is minimised.

If the business experiencing **diseconomies of scale**, you want to **scale down to the minimum efficient scale** to reduce costs to compete more effectively.

This is because under perfect competition, firms must operate at minimum efficient scale in the long run.

The competitors under perfect competition operate at this scale in the long run, so this minimum will equal the market price, which is the marginal revenue and also the average revenue (i.e., market price = marginal revenue = average revenue).
