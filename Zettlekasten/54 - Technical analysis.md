## Technical analysis
### Principles of technical analysis
**Technical analysis** is the use of **price** and **volume** data to aid in investment decisions. Technical analysis is most suitable for securities in **freely traded markets**.

Prices are the **result of buying and selling activities**, and technical analysis believe:
- The supply and demand from sellers and buyers determine prices
- Changes in supply and demand caused changes in prices
- Price can be projects with charts and other tools

Pros of technical analysis:
- it can be applied over any time frame as patterns that are apparent in short term charts can also appear over the long term - **more desirable to traders with short term horizons**, as fundamental analysis would be too time consuming

There are several assumptions in technical analysis:
- **Market discounts everything** - market price reflect all known information (e.g. economic factors, company fundamentals, investor psychology) which fundamental analyst do not consider.
- **Price move in trends (and counter trend)** - trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse
- **Pattern and cycles repeat in predictable ways**

### Technical analysis and behavioural finance
These assumptions can possibly be explained by behavioural finance, technical analysts believe that **market prices reflect the behaviour** of both **rational** and **irrational** investors.
This implies that the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) under technical analysis, which assumes that all investors are rational, does not hold.

The technical analyst believe in:
- Investor behaviour is frequently repeated (especially since trading activity is driven by **greed and fear**) (e.g. bubbles are driven by **hope and greed**, where investors observe patterns of persistent higher prices so they buy in anticipation of selling to other buyers willing to pay a higher price in the future)
- **Investor behaviour plays the key role in the fluctuation of a securities price, not so much its intrinsic value**, even rational investors with a favourable fundamental view of the security may:
	- sell it for other reasons, including pessimistic investor sentiment,
	- margin calls
	- a need for capital

### Fundamental analysis vs technical analysis
### Fundamental analysis
**Fundamental analysis** rationale is that the **markets are efficient and rational**.

**Fundamental analysis** can be considered:
- the more **theoretical approach** as its objective is to determine the **long term value of a security.**
- "It seeks to predict what the price **should be**."
- Fundamentalists analyse (reports/research are only released periodically) - a time lag can occurs between the market's activities and the fundamentalists conclusion:
	- financial statements - The data used in fundamental analysis is also subject to assumptions or restatements and even fraud.
	- economic data
	- market research
- relying on **estimating income streams and using time value of money techniques (i.e. valuation models)** to derive intrinsic values for securities, however, commodities do not have income stream, therefore, it is not suitable for fundamental analysis
- prices can often overshoot or undershoot the intrinsic value become a case of closing a position to early before more profits can be realised.

### Technical analysis
**Technical analysis** rationale is that the market participants are emotional and irrational (tend to exhibit herd instinct).

Technical analysis can be considered:
- the more **practical approach** as it is adaptive to market conditions.
- "It seeks to predict what the price **will be**."
- Technicians focus solely on analysing through **price** and **volume** data (e.g. price and volume data is reflected instantaneously on charts)
- believe that **trends and patterns** as a result of such human behaviour and patterns repeat themselves -  recognition of such patterns and project future patterns of prices based on past data.
- help picking up trends set by insider traders as traders with the best information tend to influence prices more because they're likely to trade in higher volumes (This disproportionate influence by the insider trader is one of the bases of technical analysis)
- has the advantage in analysing commodities, as it can be applied to securities without an income stream
- **in slow to identify changes in trend** - studying price trends by technicians is that **trends can change without warning**, and it can take some time for the trend to become evident.

## Charts and chart patterns
### Types of charts
One of the primary tools used by technicians are charts of price and volume charts are excellent visual aids to spot trends and patterns.

Some of the more common charts used by technicians:
Â - **Line charts** - simple, graphical plots of data points connected by lines. The data points are usually the closing price.
Â - **Bar charts** - show the range for that time period including opening and closing price
Â - **Candlestick charts** - like bar charts, but displaying a box bounded by the opening and closing prices (make it easier to recognise patterns and spot trends)

Besides price, technicians are concerned with volume as well. Volume charts are usually displayed below the price chart, with each period's volume shown in a vertical bar.

#### Linear vs log scale
**Linear scale** is usually suitable when data ranges are small. For data where the is huge like that of a stock index over a long period of time, this might be the kind of data an analyst sees.

The shortcoming here is that it's easy for the analysts to miss events like this on the linear chart. The index chart dropped by 56% at this point yet it just appears as a tiny blip in this chart.

A **logarithmic scale** can help in such a case in this scale. Equal vertical distances correspond to an equal percentage change. As such, the crash in the index becomes much more apparent in the log scale.

### Trends
There are basically two trends:
- **Uptrend**
- **Downtrend**

#### Uptrend
A security is said to be an **uptrend** if its prices are consistently reaching **higher highs and higher lows**, a**n uptrend means the demand is increasing**. A **trend line** can be drawn by joining the lows to identify if a trend is continuing or reversing trend lines are also support lines where buying is expected to take place based on psychology of the buyers.

As such, if the price goes convincingly below the trend line, a breakdown is said to have occurred and the uptrend is discontinued.

Support lines can also occur at important levels on the chart. This line also highlights an important principle in technical analysis called the change in polarity.

e.g. support line is where buyers are eager to buy in anticipation that the price will bounce back up.

Notice that before it became a support, it was a resistance level.

Change in polarity is the belief that breached resistance levels become support levels and vice versa.

#### Downtrend
Conversely, a security is said to be in **downtrend** if its prices are consistently reaching **lower highs and lower lows**. A downtrend means the **supply is increasing**.

Likewise, a trend line can be drawn by joining the highs to identify if the downtrend is continuing or reversing. The trend line is also a resistance line where selling is expected to take place based on psychology of the sellers.


As such, if the price goes convincingly above the trend line, a breakout is said to have occurred on the downtrend is discontinued. Resistance lines can also occur at important levels on the chart.

For example, this line appears to be a resistance where sellers are eager to sell in anticipation that

the price will drop back down.

Similarly, a change in polarity is also observed here, where a former support level was breached and

becomes a resistance level.

### Patterns
There are different types of patterns:
- **Reversal patterns** - considered a reversal pattern as it indicates weakness in buying pressure that has been driving the uptrend, or prices reach a resistance level at which buying exhausts and selling intensifies.
	- **Head-and-shoulder pattern** 
	- **Triple top**
	- **Double top**
- **Continuation pattern** - buying and selling have temporarily become roughly equal
	- **Triangle pattern** - the pattern of higher lows and a resistance level emerges (i.e. ascending triangle); the pattern of lower highs and a support level emerges (i.e. descending triangle); symmetric triangle - The pattern is more likely to end in the same direction as the trend that preceded it
	- **Rectangle** - the prevailing trend will resume, the width of the rectangle
	- **Pennant** 
	- **Flag**

## Technical indicators
### Price-based indicators
**Price-based indicators** incorporate information contained in current and past prices and provide insights on the supply and demand on the security.

A price-based indicator includes :
- **Moving average** 
- **Bollinger bands** 

#### Moving average
**Moving average** is **the average of the closing price over n periods**. In an uptrend, the price is predominantly higher than the moving averageI n a downtrend, the price is predominantly lower than the moving average.

Analysts often use the **crossing of short term with long term moving average** as an indicator of a change in price trend.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 19.06.10.png]]

#### Bollinger bands
**Bollinger bands** involve in plotting a number of **standard deviations** above and below the moving average to get the upper and lower Bollinger Bands. 

The Bollinger Bands can indicate if the security is overbought or oversold, when the price is close to or above the upper bound. It's likely to be overbought. Likewise, when the price is close to or below the lower band, it's likely to be oversold. 

A possible strategy is to buy when the price is at the lower band or sell when the price is at the upper band. This is an example of a **contrarian strategy**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 19.08.00.png]]

### Oscillators
**Oscillators** are another group of tools that can be used to pick up overbought or oversold signals (besides using Bollinger band to pick up these signals). Oscillators **oscillate around a mean** where **extreme high values from the mean indicate overbought** conditions and **extreme low values from the mean indicate oversold** conditions. They can also be used to identify **convergence** or **divergence**.

There are 4 different types of commonly used oscillators:
- **ROC oscillator (rate of change oscillator; momentum oscillator)**
- **Relative strength index (RSI)**
- **Moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD)**
- **Stochastic indicator**

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 19.11.50.png]]

#### Convergence
**Convergence** is when the **oscillator is moving in tandem with the price**. Both the price and the oscillator are both trending up. Convergence suggests that the price trend is likely to continue. But in this case, the indicator is wrong, highlighting the reality that technical analysis is not always right.

This is an example of a divergence where the oscillator is not moving in tandem with the price.

#### Divergence
**Divergence** where the **oscillator is not moving in tandem with the price**. Notice that while the price is continuing, heading up, the oscillator is actually trending down, divergence suggests that the price may potentially change.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 19.14.33.png]]

#### ROC oscillator 
ROC oscillator or momentum oscillator is the first and simplest oscillator. This oscillator is calculated as 100 times the difference between the current price on the price n days prior to it.

The equation of the ROC oscillator is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROC\,oscillator=(P_curr-P_{curr-n})\times100}$$
where $P_{curr}$: current price; $P_{curr-n}$: price n days prior to current price. It oscillates around 0.

One way the oscillator can be used is to buy when the oscillator changes from negative to positive during an uptrend in price and vice versa during a downtrend.

e.g. A downtrend has a clear change from positive to negative. In hindsight, a trader would have benefited from this signal if he shorted here.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 20.38.38.png]]

#### Relative strength index (RSI)
The **relative strength index (RSI)** is based on the ratio of total price increases to total price decreases over n prior periods, and it is scaled to oscillate between 0 and 100.

The equation of relative strength (RS) is as follows: 
$$\mathrm{RS=\frac{Total\,price\,increase}{Total\,price\,decrease}}$$
where the total price increase/decrease over n period.

The equation of relative strength index (RSI) is as follows:
$$\mathrm{RSI=100-\frac{100}{1+RS}}$$
where this is scaled to oscillate between 0 and 100.

A RSI > 70 indicates overbought conditions, which is sell signal; while the RSI < 30, indicates oversold conditions, which indicates to buy.
Again, this is a **contrarian strategy** - to buy when the market is oversold and sell when the market is overbought.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 20.39.17.png]]

#### Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD)
**Moving averages** that the short term moving average moves faster than the long term moving average. **Take the difference between them**, we get the **moving average convergence divergence oscillator (MACD)**.

The equation of the MACD is as follows:
$$\mathrm{MACD=Short\,term\,MA-Long\,term\,MA}$$
where MA: moving average. The MACD oscillates around 0.

The MACD can be simply used to indicate overbought or oversold conditions or identify convergence or divergence with the price trend. 

Some analysts will add on the MACD signal line, this line is the exponentially smoothed average of the MACD, generally 9 days.

If the MACD crosses below the signal line, it's a sell signal. If the MACD crosses above the signal line, it's a buy signal.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 20.46.44.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 20.49.54.png]]

#### Stochastic indicator
**Stochastic indicator** also uses two lines for buy and sell signals. The two lines are called the **%K line and the %D line** (which is the 3-period average of the %K line).

%K crossing below %D would indicate a sell, while the reverse would indicate a buy. The stochastic is calculated from the latest closing price on the maximum and minimum prices reached in a recent period. It's bounded between 0 and 100.

The logic behind it is that in a sustainable uptrend, the prices will tend to close nearer to recent highs and vice versa for a downtrend. As such, when the values are extreme, it indicates that the trend is sustainable. We can see from this example that the stochastic indicator is quite accurate in predicting the sustainability of the downtrend.

### Sentiment indicators
The key sentiments that these indicators try to gauge are investor bullishness or bearishness.

Sentiment indicators can be subdivided into:
- **Opinion polls**
- **Calculated statistical indices**
	- Put/call ratio
	- CBOE VIX
	- Margin debt
	- Short interest ratio

#### Opinion polls
**Opinion polls** are polls on individual investors **on a regular basis** by compiling these data over time and presenting them graphically. Technicians can use **patterns and relationships inferred from such data to forecast the future direction** of the market. Opinion polls tend to be useful when analysed over a long period of time and require extensive effort to compile the data. As such, only very developed markets like the U.S. have such data.

#### Calculated statistical indicies
**Calculated statistical indices** are derived from market data and less subjective.

There are quite a few of calculated statistical indices:
- **Put/call ratio**

##### Put/call ratio
A **put option on a stock** is a derivative that **decreases in value** when the stock price increases, while the corresponding **call option increases in value**.

The **put/call ratio** is the **proportion of put volume to call volume**, put/call ratio equation:
$$\mathrm{Put/call\,ratio=\frac{Put\,volume}{Call\,volume}}$$
where a rising ratio indicates increasing bearishness, while a falling ratio indicates increasing bullishness. It's often used in a **contrarian strategy** as a signal to buy at extremely high ratios, which indicates an oversold market and to sell at extremely low ratios, which indicates an overbought market.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 20.59.46.png]]

##### CBOE Vix
The **Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or CBOE VIX**, is a popular measure of the **implied volatility of options of the S&P 500**.

High levels of the VIX indicates that investors are fearful of an impending stock market decline, as can be seen in the spike in the index during periods of sharp market declines like that of the global financial crisis.

The VIX is often viewed in a contrarian way by technicians, and extreme spike in the index indicates extreme investor fear, which could be overblown and therefore a good opportunity to buy in.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 21.06.50.png]]

##### Margin debt
Stock purchases are often funded through margin debt, brokerage firms are required to report the amount of **margin debt** in clients' accounts. This data is readily available.

The **correlation between the amount of margin debt and the market index is striking**, increase in stock prices is tightly correlated with margin debt as investors become increasingly bullish and increase their borrowings.

However, as many investors reach the limits of their credit line decreases and prices start to fall as prices fall, investors sell more to meet margin calls.

This causes the price to fall further and the domino effect causes the market to plunge.

One way to interpret margin debt for trading decisions is to be wary of sharp increases in the level of margin debt. The margin debt has historically been a precursor of a sharp market correction. 

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 21.07.13.png]]

##### Short interest ratio
**Short interest ratio** is when short sellers borrow shares and sell them short.

The short interest is the number of stocks sold short on the short interest ratio contextualizes the short volume against the average daily trading volume.

The short interest ratio equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Short\,interest\,ratio=\frac{Short\,interest}{Avg. daily\,trading\,volume}}$$
where the short interest: number of stocks sold short.

An increase in the ratio indicates increased bearishness. Though analysts are divided on how to interpret it, some expect the price to fall further when the ratio is high, while others take a contrarian approach and expect the price to rise as short sellers buy back shares to cover their short positions.

## Intermarket analysis and application to portfolio management
### Intermarket analysis
market analysis is the analysis of the relationships between different asset classes.

The objective is to identify market trends and possible changes in trends.

This is often done by charting the price of one asset class to that of another.

A technique known as **relative strength analysis**.

In this example, we chart the relative strength of the S&P 500 against gold price.

We can see that gold is the better performing asset in the first half of this period.

We can see that gold is the better performing asset in the first half of this period.

We can also see a clear bottom and a clear reversal of the trend.

From then on, with the S&P 500 outperforming gold from that point.

This change of trend indicates that moving funds away from gold into U.S. stocks might be appropriate.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 21.19.36.png]]

This change of trend indicates that moving funds away from gold into U.S. stocks might be appropriate.

Continuing on with our example, we have determined through into market analysis that moving funds from

gold into U.S. stocks may be desirable.

So which sector should we move into?

Into market analysis can also be used to identify sectors of the equity market to invest in.

The analyst can analyze each of the sectors against the broad market index, like the S&P 500, in order

to find the sector with the most potential.

Again, relative strength analysis can be performed.

In this chart, which blocks the performance of tech stocks relative to the broad index, we can observe

that tech stocks are beginning to outperform the broader market after a period of underperformance.

Assuming that the trend will continue, it may be appropriate to overweight on tech stocks in this case.

In essence, relative strength analysis is a useful technique for analyzing relative trends across international

markets, asset classes and specific industries or sectors.

### Application to portfolio management
You can see how this is useful in the context of portfolio management for a manager that adopts the

top down approach into market analysis can help the manager identify countries or regions or specific

asset classes right up to the specific sectors that the portfolio should overweight in.

It can even be used along with charts and indicators to help the manager to identify specific stocks

to invest in.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 21.23.03.png]]



Take techniques can also be used in the bottom up portfolio management approach.

Managers simply start by identifying specific securities to trade in based on signals like trends,

price breakouts or breakdowns or indicators, irrespective of market, industry or economic trends.
![[Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 21.23.51.png]]



However, it is possible that a thorough analysis of individual stocks may reveal investment themes

in different sectors and industries.

For example, several bottom reversals on individual energy stocks might suggest a turnaround in that

sector due to anticipated news or a change in fundamentals.


T.A. can also serve a supporting role in fundamental portfolio management in such portfolios.

Managers determine the portfolio allocation and specific securities based on fundamental analysis,

but may choose to use today techniques to determine the timing of the purchase or sale of the specific

securities.
