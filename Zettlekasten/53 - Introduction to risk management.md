## The risk management process
### Definition of risk management
The **risk management process**:
- Seeks to **establish an appropriate risk tolerance level** for the organisation or individual
- Identify and measure the risks currently being taken
- Modify and monitor these risks, such as they are consistent with the stated risk tolerance

For an organisation, the goal of risk management is to maximize the company's **portfolio's value**. For individual, the goal is to maximize the individual's **overall satisfaction** or utility.

**Risk management** is not about minimising risk. Rather, the objective is to understand and embrace those risks that are necessary to achieve certain goals or outcomes, but being mindful that there is a probability of failure.

Risks that are less tolerable or undesirable can be mitigated or eliminated through:
- making organisational changes
- purchasing insurance
- entering into hedging positions

### Risk management framework
**Risk management framework** is the infrastructure and processes needed to support effective risk management activities, any organisation should encompass:
- **Risk governance**
- **Risk identification and measurement**
- **Risk infrastructure**
- **Defined policies and processes**
- **Risk monitoring, mitigation and management**
- **Communications** 
- **Strategic risk analysis**

All of these risk management activities will be discussed in conjunction. 

**Risk governance,** where the board committee:
- defines the goals of the organisation
- decides on its risk tolerance level
- provide guidance on **risk budgeting**
- involved in setting a high level policies

The **role of management** in risk management:
- Plan and execute value maximising strategies
- Allocate capital to risky activities to execute its strategies
- Overall risk exposure should be consistent with a defined risk tolerance and should also be **aligned with a risk budget**
- Participates actively in implementing risk management policies and establishing procedures that relate to how each of the elements of the risk framework are performed,
- Establishes a **risk management infrastructure** where employees and systems are required to **identify risks** and to **measure** and **monitor** them
	- At the **monitoring stage**, management must check that all the risks are in line with the planned limits of risk exposure
		- **communicating risk levels** across the organisation with reporting key metrics/KPI
		- **strategic analysis** is supported by the risk management reporting and other steps of the risk management process
	- If there is any risk that is **not in line**, **risk mitigation and management** actions need to be taken to **modify risk levels** and to bring them back into compliance.

Important feedback loop to the management.

## Risk governance
### Risk governance
**Risk governance** is the top down process and guidance that directs risk management activities to support the goals of the organisation.

Risk governance is directed by the **board of directors** to:
1. **Determine the goals**
2. Spells out the **risk tolerance**
	- risks are acceptable and **necessary to achieve** the organisation goals
	- risks to be mitigated
	- risks are unacceptable and should be eliminated if possible
- **Risk governance** should also provide a sense of the **worst losses that could be tolerated** in various scenarios.
- All these considerations flow naturally into decisions about **risk budgeting** to guide implementation of an optimal risk allocation program that's consistent with a **risk tolerance** of the organisation.

Risk governance extends into **management**:
- To include ways to ensure that the risk framework stays consistent with **top-level guidance**
- **Risk-management committee** forum for various parts of the organisation to bring up issues for **risk measurement, risk integration, and risk mitigation**
- **Appointment of Chief Risk Officer (CRO)** responsible for building, implementing, and managing the risk framework and its activities

Besides, all these, **governance also entails compliance with regulatory requirements**, most financial institutions are bound by local regulators on the amount of risk that they're allowed to take.

### Risk tolerance
**Risk tolerance** focuses on the **overall appetite for risk**, **what is unacceptable/acceptable risk**, identifies the extent to which the organisation is willing to experience losses or **opportunity costs and to fail in meeting its objectives**.

Determining an organisation's **risk tolerance** involves:
- Setting the **overall risk exposure**
- Examine internal risks
- Examine external risks
- Various risks must be considered against the expected benefits of bearing those risks and how they align with the overall goals of the organisation.

Some of the factors that determine an organisation's risk tolerance are:
- Expertise in its lines of of business
- Skills at responding to negative outside events
- Regulatory environment
- Financial strength

### Risk budgeting
**Risk budgeting** has a specific focus on **how** that risk is taken. Risk budgeting is the **process of allocating firm resources** to investments by **considering their various risk and return characteristics** and how they combine to **meet the organisation's risk and return objectives**.

The goal is to **allocate the overall amount of acceptable risk** to the mix of investments such that the risk budget is it here, too, yet **maximizing the expected returns over time**.

A risk budget can be based on a simple **one-dimensional risk measure**:
- Beta
- Value at risk (VAR)
- portfolio duration
- standard deviation of returns

More complex forms of risk budgeting use multiple dimensions of risk:
- underlying risk classes such as equity, fixed income, commodity risk and so on, and then allocates investments by their risk class.
- another way to allocate risk budget is to identify specific risk factors that compromise the overall risk of the organisation (e.g. equity market risk, interest rate risk, forex risk)

## Identification of risk
The identification of risk are **based on source** and **not the outcome**.

There are broadly two categories of risk:
- **Financial risks** - arise from the financial market
- **Non-financial risks** - arise from internal sources, environment, suppliers, regulators, customers

### Financial risks
There are 3 main types of financial risk:
- **Market risk** - arises from asset prices, exchange rates, interest rates
- **Credit risk** (i.e. default/counter-party risk) - risk of loss if counter-party fails to fulfil its obligations (e.g. bond, loan, derivatives)
- **Liquidity risk** - risk of loss when selling an asset at less than its fair value; it is affected by the market size, market conditions, trade size

### Non-financial risk
There are several types of non-financial risk:
- **Settlement risk** - occurs due to the timing of payment process (e.g. currency swap)
- **Legal risk** - risk that the terms of a contract may not be upheld by the legal system
- **Compliance risk** - uncertainties with regards to policies, laws and regulations
	- **Regulatory risk** - the regulators
	- **Accounting risk** - accounting standards board
	- **Tax risk** - tax authorities
- **Model risk** - asset valuation are incorrect due to using a wrong model, or using the right model incorrectly (e.g. valuation model of using constant growth model when high growth is unsustainable)
- **Tail risk** - extreme events are more likely than that the probability model suggest (e.g. assumed normal distribution but instead negatively skewed/left skewed with fatter tails)
- **Operational risk** - arises from people and processes that combine to produce the output of an organisation
- **Solvency risk** - organisation unable to continue to operate because it has run out of cash
	- taking on less debt 
	- securing more stable sources of financing
	- monitoring solvency risk at board level in risk governance
	- holding more cash and equivalents and assets with less liquidity risk
	- good measure of tail risk of market (e.g. Lehman brothers before bankruptcy for research)

### Individual-specific risks
All of the risks mentioned above are related to individuals risks, on top of that:
- **Health risk** - e.g. health care expenses, lower income due to disability, decrease quality of life; it can be addressed by health insurance
- **Mortality risk** - e.g. death prior to providing for family's future needs ; it can be addressed by life insurance
- **Longevity risk** - living longer than anticipated such that assets run out; purchase life time annuity

### Interaction amongst risks
Consider an oil drilling rig buildup that's exposed to market risk of oil price fluctuations. It takes the short position and oil forwards to hedge that risk.

If oil price declines significantly, the firm is owed a payment from the counterparty, so there is now significant counterparty or credit risk.

There also may be legal risks if the counterparty seeks to avoid the payment through loopholes in the contract.

Credit losses and legal losses may result in greater liquidity risk as the excess drilling rigs must be sold to meet its cash flow needs.

Losses from selling in a market with weak demand may increase solvency risk because of the negative impact on the firm's cash position.

Lenders may be unwilling to lend because of the industry downturn triggered by the decrease in oil price.

So as you can see, interactions among risks are important and must be considered because of the domino effect one risk can have on the rest. This is especially so during periods of stress in financial markets.

## Measuring risk
Different ways of measuring market risks across different asset classes:
- **Probability** - for portfolio
- **Standard deviation** - for portfolio
- **Beta** - for equities
- **Duration** - for fixed income (e.g. bonds)
- **Greeks** (e.g. delta, gamma, vega, rho) - for derivatives (e.g. options, futures, swaps) 

It is also desirable to have a **common measure applicable** across different asset classes.
Moreover, risk managers are more interested in **tail risk or downside risk**, that is the **probability of extreme negative outcomes**, therefore **Value at Risk (VaR)** would be a better measure.

### Probability
The most basic metric associated with risk is **probability**.
For example, one way of quantifying risk is to estimate the probability of incurring a financial loss from an investment.
However, this does not give us a lot of information about the risk, we may know the probability of incurring a loss, but we don't know how bad the loss can get.

### Standard deviation
**Standard deviation** is the range over which a certain percentage of the outcomes would be expected to occur. 

**Standard deviation** measures the volatility of the asset returns. The less risk asset indicates less volatility of return with smaller standard deviations, thinner tails and higher kurtosis (greater than normal). 

![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 17.14.49.png |400]]

However, the limitation of standard deviation is that the return of assets do not approximate to normal. **Standard deviation** is not the appropriate measure of risk in non-normal distribution, especially negatively skewed and excess/positive kurtosis.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 17.18.53.png|500]]

**Standard deviation** overstates the risk of an asset in the context of a diversified portfolio, as the unsystematic risk of an asset can be diversified away. The more appropriate risk to be measured in this case is just the systematic risk which can be measured by the assets'
Beta.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 17.20.10.png|500]]

### Beta
**Beta ($\beta$)** is widely used to **measure risk for equities**. It's the sensitivity of a stock price to the movement of the stock market. 

### Duration
For most fixed income instruments (e.g. bonds), the primary risk factor is **interest rate risk**, so **duration** is often used as the measure of the risk.

**Duration** is a measure of the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates and has covered extensively in the fixed income course.

### Derivatives risk
The measure of risk for **derivatives** (e.g. futures, options, swaps) is critical as most derivatives exposures are highly **leveraged**. There are several **specialised measures of derivatives risk** and we collectively refer to them as "the Greeks".
The Greeks include:
- Delta ($\delta$) - sensitivity of **derivatives' value** to a small change in the **price of the underlying asset** (1st order risk)
- Gamma ($\gamma$) - sensitivity of **delta** to changes in the **price of the underlying asset** (2nd order risk)
- Vega (v) - a measure of the sensitivity of a **derivatives' value** to a change in the **price volatility of the underlying asset**; (options, which is sensitive to changes in the price volatility of the underlying)
- Rho ($\rho$) - sensitivity of **derivatives' value** to **changes in interest rate**

![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 17.26.04.png]]

### Value at Risk (VaR)
The **value at risk (VaR)** is a measure of the size of the tail and is applicable across several different classes of assets. One important thing to note about VaR is that it only specifies the **minimum loss over a period**, it **does not estimate the maximum loss** or **give an expected value of the loss**.

There are 3 components for VaR:
- Time period
- Minimum loss (in currency units)
- Probability

e.g. a bank can have a "one-day VaR of $2 million with a 5% probability". This means that a loss of at least 2 million dollars in a day is expected to occur 5% of the time or 1 in every 20 days. VaR is widely accepted as a risk measure for banks and is used in **establishing minimum capital requirements**.

### Condition value at risk (CVaR)
The **conditional value at risk (CVaR)** is the expected value of a loss, given that the loss **exceeds a minimum amount stated in VaR**.

There are 3 components for VaR:
- Time period
- Minimum loss (in currency units)
- Expected loss

e.g. if a bank "one-day loss exceeds $2 million, the expected loss is $2.6 million".
CVaR is similar to the **measure of loss severity** given default that is used in estimating default risk for debt securities.

### Calculating VaR
There are various methods of calculating VaR. Both the **inputs** and **models used** will affect the **calculated VaR** significantly.

As is always the case, with estimates of risk, **incorrect inputs** or **inappropriate distribution assumptions** will lead to **misleading results**, sometimes giving people a false sense of security. Given these limitations, VaR should be used in **conjunction with other risk measures**.

Two measures in particular that are often used to complement to VaR:
- **Stress testing** - examine the effects when **a single specific key** variable is pushed to an extreme value
- **Scenario analysis** - Scenario analysis is similar, but incorporates changes in multiple variables.
These are common sense approaches that ask, "if this happens, then how is the company affected?"

#### Example of stress testing and scenario analysis
**Stress testing**
e.g. , a highly leveraged utilities company may want to examine if the company is able to remain solvent, if the market interest rate increases to a worst case of 10%.

**Scenario analysis**
e.g. The utilities company may want to combine an increase in interest rate with a significant increase in oil prices and a weakening of the local currency to analyse if the company can survive this combination of shocks.

### Other risks measurements
There are other types of risk:
- **Credit risk**
- **Operational risk**
- **Tax/regulatory risk**

However, they are difficult to estimate and quantify, and events are rare and unique in nature.

#### Credit risk
**Credit risk** is hard to measure as most surviving firms have never experienced significant financial distress, the risk of bankruptcy is therefore often a **subjective estimate** rather than a data driven estimate.

Estimates of credit risk can also be based on the **market prices of insurance**, **derivatives** (e.g. **credit default swaps (CDS)** of a company can be used to estimate the credit risk of the company) or **other securities** that can be used to **hedge those risks**.

### Operational risk
**Operational risks** are difficult to quantify for a single organisation:
- very difficult to predict
- can vary widely in nature
- the consequences can vary widely in severity

One way to approach this problem is to examine a large sample of similar firms in order to determine **an overall probability of significant losses (i.e. p(significant loss))** due to operational risks and the **average loss** of firms that have experienced such losses and use these to **estimate** the operational risk of the firm.

### Tax/regulatory risk
**Unexpected changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment can impose large costs on an organisation**, the political nature of such changes makes them quite difficult to predict.

Again, **subjective estimates** rather than data driven quantitative estimates are necessary. As is often the case, having a subjective estimate of the risk is better than not addressing the risk factor at all.

## Method of risk modification
If a risk is not in line with a management's planned risk exposure for the company, the **risk should be modified**. **Risk modification** can be both risk reduction and risk appreciation. In some cases, risk needs to be increased if it is unacceptably low, such that the target return cannot be met, the goal of risk modification is to retain the **optimal mix of risks** for the organisation.

There are 5 methods of modifying the risk once recognised:
- Avoid
- Eliminate
- Accept/bear
- Transfer
- Shift

These risk modification techniques **are not mutually exclusive**, organisations may use multiple methods of risk modification to reduce a single risk. The criterion is always a **comparison** of the **benefits and costs of risk modification**.

Whether it is one approach or a combination of approaches to modify the risks, the end result should always be a risk profile that matches the risk tolerance established for the organisation and is consistent with the goals of the organisation.

### Risk avoidance
One simple way to **avoid a risk** is to **not engage** in the activity in almost everything in life.
There's a **trade off** between risk and benefits. If we choose to **avoid a risk altogether,** we **forego the benefits** that come with it.

e.g. If a company prefers to avoid the risk of doing business in an emerging market, it can simply choose not to expand into the market. Doing so also means that the company forgoes the potential higher growth that business from an emerging market can bring to the company, in this case, the company's management most probably feels the **risk outweighs the benefit, thus the decision to avoid**.

### Risk elimination
**Risk elimination** is to prevent or eliminate the risk through solutions.

e.g. the risk of a data breach can be prevented or eliminated by spending resources to develop a strong IT protection system. In this case, the benefits of reducing or eliminating the risk are judged to be greater than the cost of doing so. (benefits > costs)

### Accept/ bear the risk
For risks where the **costs to eliminate are higher than the potential benefits** (cost > benefits), the management **may decide to accept the risks**.

This is to be done in the most **efficient manner** possible. **Usually achieved through diversification by accepting other uncorrelated risks** that are in line with a company's goals.

Another approach is to establish a **reserve account** to cover losses as a way of mitigating the impact of losses on the organisation.

#### Self-insurance vs. denial in accepting/bearing the risk
Sometimes the term **self-insurance** is used to describe such a situation where an organisation has decided to bear a risk. **Self-insurance** is an **intentional decision based on risk analysis and strategic decision making**, in contrast, **denial** simply **represents inaction due to the management, neglect or indifference towards the risk**.

### Risk transfer
For a risk, an organisation has decided not to bear **risk transfer** or **risk shifting** can be employed. Managements that purchase them have determined that the benefits of the risk transfer outweigh the costs of the insurance (benefit > cost).

There are several types of insurance:
- insurance
- surety bond
- fidelity bond

#### Insurance
e.g. Whether risk transfer to another party, usually an insurer, takes on the risk, for example, a company can transfer the risk of fire, destroying its office building to an insurance company by buying an **insurance policy** and paying the **policy premiums**.

#### Surety bond
A very **slight variation of insurance is a surety bond**. The risk being transferred to the insurer here is the risk that a third party fails to perform under the terms of a contract or agreement with the organisation

e.g. For example, if a key supplier does not deliver its goods on time as per the contract, the insurer has to pay the receiving company an amount to compensate for the losses due to the delay.

### Fidelity bonds
Insurers also issue Fidelity bonds, which will pay for losses that result from employee theft or misconduct.

#### Risk management for insurance companies
**Risk management for insurance companies** is crucial as insurers **take on several risks as its primary business**. f the risk is not managed properly, the company could end up with **solvency issues** if claims are made around the same time.

The insurance company:
- diversify across many risks â‡’ some insured parties pay the losses of others
- not highly correlated risks
- buying reinsurance to transfer the risk to another insurance company

### Risk shifting
**Risk shifting** refers to actions that **change the distribution of risk outcomes** and as accomplished, primarily **with derivative contracts**.

e.g. A firm with a large position in a specific stock is exposed to a likelihood of total loss if the stock becomes worthless. The firm can buy a put option on the stock that effectively alters the distribution of risk outcomes such that there is a floor to the maximum loss that the firm can incur.
