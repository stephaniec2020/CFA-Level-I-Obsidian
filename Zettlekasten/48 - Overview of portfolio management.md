## Portfolio approach to investing
**Diversified portfolio of investments** along with **constant evaluation** of individual investments by their contribution to the **risk and return** of the entire portfolio is import which helps investors **avoid disastrous investment outcomes**.

Reduce overall risk
No decrease in expected return (expected rate of return)

One measure of the benefits of diversification is the **diversification ratio**.
**Diversification ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Diversification\,ratio=\frac{Std.\,dev.\,of\,equal\,weighted\,portfolio}{Std.\,dev.\,of\,randomly\,selected\,security}}$$
which the standard deviation of the randomly selected security can be replaced by the average standard deviation of all securities of the portfolio. Obviously, the lower the ratio, the higher the diversification benefit.

Although this is not mentioned in the curriculum, **diversification ratio** equation could also be (according to calculation and chatGPT):
$$\mathrm{Diversification\,ratio=\frac{\sigma_portfolio}{\sigma_{weighted\,securities}}}$$
where: Ïƒp: the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns; Ïƒs: the weighted average standard deviation of the individual securities' returns in the portfolio.

### Weightage of portfolio
One important thing to note is that an equal weighted portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio that has the lowest possible standard deviation for this set of assets.

There lies a set of weights that produces the minimum portfolio standard deviation for this group of assets. And computer optimisation techniques can be used to calculate them.

This is known as the global minimum variance portfolio, which we'll learn later in this course.

### Correlation of returns
Besides the weightage, another major factor that influences the effectiveness of diversification is the correlation of returns between the various securities. When the returns between assets are highly correlated, the benefits of diversification diminishes. Conversely, when the return between assets have little correlation, the benefits of correlation increases.

However, even if a portfolio is made up of assets that have little correlation with each other, correlations tend to increase during periods of market turmoil.

In the 2008 global financial crisis, almost all risky assets fell in value as investors panicked and rushed for the exits.

### Modern portfolio theory (MPT) introduction
**Modern portfolio theory** states there is limited downside protection even for a well diversified portfolio. The **systematic risk in assets is non diversified**. The **asset-specific risk is diversifiable as we increase the number of securities in the portfolio**.

The main conclusion of empty is that investors should focus on how individual securities in the portfolios are related to one another **in order to achieve maximum benefit of diversification**, which is to **reduce the-asset specific risk of the portfolio**.

## Types of investors
### Distinguishing characteristics that defines an investor
- **Investment horizon** - the length of time that the investor expects to hold the portfolio
- **Risk tolerance** - the degree of variability in returns that the investor is able and willing to withstand
- **Income needs** - degree of withdrawal needs expected from the portfolio
- **Liquidity needs** - to meet unexpected claims or withdrawals from the portfolio

### Individual investors
For individual investors, there are different reasons for investment:
- **Home purchase fund**
- **Children's education fund**
- **Retirement fund**

In the early stages, **younger individuals**:
- **Investment horizon** - long
- **Risk tolerance** - high
- **Income needs** - low
- **Liquidity needs** - low
Mostly investing for growth, therefore **capital gain** would be their **primary objectives** and assets like **growth stocks and commodities** would be suitable for these individuals. 

**Retiree** are in general with:
- **Investment horizon** - short
- **Risk tolerance** - low
- **Income needs** - high
- **Liquidity needs** - high
Therefore, **fixed income and dividend stocks** would be better options for them.

### Institutional investors
There are different types of institutional investors:
- **Defined benefit pension plans**
- **Endowments/foundations**
- **Banks**
- **Insurance companies**
- **Investment companies**
- **Sovereign wealth fund**

#### Defined benefit pension plans
In **defined benefit pension plans**, an employer is obliged to pay a fixed annual amount to its employees when they retire. The benefit is usually based on the employees years of service and the compensation at retirement. The **employees future benefit is defined**, the **employer assumes the investment risk**. 

In defined benefit pension plans, the employer is to make contributions based on projected future liabilities and investment rate of return.

The employer is required to make adequate contributions to the pension fund to ensure that it is able to provide the promised future benefits. So if the investment performance is poor, the employer may have to increase the amount of contribution.

For **young companies** with are a **young workforce**, the investment profile is:
- **Investment horizon** - long
- **Risk tolerance** - high
- **Income needs** - low
- **Liquidity needs** - low

For **mature companies**, their workforce have retired and are retiring soon, therefore their investment profile is:
- **Investment horizon** - short
- **Risk tolerance** - low
- **Income needs** - high
- **Liquidity needs** - high

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 20.40.42.png]]

Do be aware of the differences from a **defined contribution plan**.

Under a defined contribution plan, the firm makes no promise on the future value of the plan assets, so the employee does not know how much she'll be getting when she retires.

Rather, the employer just makes regular contributions to the employees retirement account based on factors such as years of service, the employees age, compensation and firm profitability. The investment decisions are left to the employee who assumes all of the investment risk.

#### Endowments/foundations
An **endowment** is a fund that is dedicated to providing **ongoing financial support** for a **specific purpose** (e.g. in the U.S., many universities have large endowment funds to support their programs)

A **foundation** is a fund established to provide **ongoing financial support** for **charitable purposes** (e.g. building schools or to fund research to fight a particular disease).

A **typical investment objective** for both endowments and foundations is to **fund the activity on a continuing basis without decreasing the real value of the portfolio assets**.

As a result of these factors, a **foundations and endowment** investment profile tend to be:
- **Investment horizon** - long
- **Risk tolerance** - high
- **Income needs** - planned spending
- **Liquidity needs** - low

#### Banks
**Banks** typically accept deposits and extend loans.

In some cases, banks need to invest their excess reserves, which are deposits that have not been used to make loans.

The objective is to earn a return that exceeds the rate of interest it pays to the Depositors'. The bank has to maintain **sufficient liquidity** to meet unexpected surge in withdrawals from depositors. 

As a result of these factors, a bank's investment profile tend to be:
- **Investment horizon** - short
- **Risk tolerance** - low
- **Income needs** - low
- **Liquidity needs** - high
As a result of these factors, the investment horizon is short and banks are typically conservative investors seeking low risk investments in the form of **fixed income** and **money market** instruments that are sufficiently liquid.

#### Insurance companies
Insurance companies **receive premiums for the policies** they write and they need to **invest much of these premiums** in a manner that will allow them to pay claims. Insurance companies covers **life insurance** and **non-life insurance** (i.e. auto and home insurance) and non-life insurance generally have shorter time horizons..

Generally, investment companies investment profile:
- **Investment horizon** - short
- **Risk tolerance** - low
- **Income needs** - low
- **Liquidity needs** - high

### Investment companies
**Investment companies** manages mutual funds. A **mutual fund** is a **pooled investment** where investors place their capital to have it invested by an investment manager. 

For many individual investors, the **mutual fund** is an **efficient means to benefit from portfolio diversification** and the **skill of a professional manager**.

Funds can vary according to:
- types of asset (stocks, bonds, commodity) 
- trading style (index, value, growth)
- region (US, EU and other countries)

The **investment horizon**, **risk tolerance** and **income needs** all vary by the type of fund.
Liquidity needs tend to be high to meet redemptions from investors.

## Steps in the portfolio management process
There are 3 stages to manage client's portfolio:
- **Planning**
- **Execution**
- **Feedback**

### Planning stage
In the planning stage, the portfolio manager has to understand the potential client's:
- **Risk tolerance**
- **Return objectives**
- **Time horizon**
- **Tax exposure**
- **Liquidity needs**
- **Legal constraints**
- **Unique circumstances**
Remember the acronym "RRTTLLU".

After the analysis, the findings should be documented in an **investment policy statement (IPS)**. The key element of the IPS is the **investment objectives and constraints** which act as **guiding principles** for any party managing the portfolio. The IPS should also **specify the benchmark** (e.g. market index, fixed rate of return) to assess the performance of the portfolio and whether objectives have been met.

The IPS should be **reviewed and updated every few years** and any time the investors objectives or constraints change significantly.

### Execution stage
Once the client has approved the IPS, you can proceed to the next stage, which is to construct a suitable portfolio for the client.

This is done by first deciding on:
1. **Target asset allocation** - analyse risk and return characteristics of various asset classes including the weights of each asset to optimise the best portfolio suitable for the client (e.g. top-down approach)
2. **Security selection** - identify the most attractive securities within each asset class (e.g. security valuation models to identify undervalued securities; i.e. bottom-up approach)
3. **Purchase of individual securities** - purchase the securities in the most cost-efficient way

**Common asset classes** identified:
- cash
- fixed income securities
- publicly traded stocks
- private equity
- real estate
- commodities

### Feedback stage
The **feedback** step can be termed the **maintenance stage**.
There are 3 main changes that would require **portfolio monitoring/rebalancing**:
- Investor circumstances
- Risk and return characteristics of asset classes due to economic changes
- Actual weight of the assets in the portfolio will change with asset prices
Target asset allocation and securities and rebalance the portfolio periodically.

Also, during the feedback stage, the portfolio manager needs to **evaluate the portfolio performance**. This is done by measuring the portfolio returns relative to the return on the benchmark identified in the IPS.

## Asset management industry
An **asset management firm** is one that manages investments for clients. Such firms can be **independent managers** or **part of a large financial firm**, and are collectively known as **"buy-side**" firms.

**"Sell-side"** are firms that facilitate the buying and selling of securities such as **securities brokers** and **investment banks**, act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of securities.

### Asset management firms (buy-side)
#### Distinction through service
There are different types of asset managers:
- **Full service asset managers** - **a variety of investment styles and asset classes**
- **Specialist asset managers** - **a particular investment style or a particular asset class**
- **Multi boutique asset manager** is a type of **asset management firm** that's made up of **several smaller investment boutiques**, each with its own **distinct investment style and portfolio management team** and provide investors with access to a variety of investment strategies and a diverse range of investment expertise and talent

#### Distinction through security types
Asset management firms may also be classified as traditional or alternative based on the asset classes:
- **Traditional asset managers** - public traded equities and fixed income securities
- **Alternative asset managers** - focus on other asset classes, such as private equity, hedge funds, real estate or commodities.

In general, **profit margins** are **higher for the alternative asset classes**. As a result, many traditional asset managers have started to include alternative investments into their portfolios, somewhat blurring the distinction between these types of firms.

#### Distinction through investment style
There are two most common type of investment style:
- **Active management** - attempts to outperform a particular benchmark through manager skill, from using technical and fundamental analysis
- **Passive management** - passive manager simply seeks to replicate the return of a particular benchmark index
- **Smart beta strategy** - is between active and passive management and can seek to achieve better returns than the index by making systematic deviations in the weights of certain securities to increase exposure to a particular market risk factor
- **Robo advisors** - recent technology that replaces human advisors to offer investment advice and recommendations to retail investors

There are differences in terms of fees on a spectrum from passive to active management. Passive management represents about 20% of global assets under management. Its share of industry revenue is even smaller because fees for passive management are typically much lower than for active management.

However, the market share for passive management has been growing in recent years as investors increasingly find value in the lower fees while questioning the value of active management.

**Robo advisors** target audience seems to be more younger investors tend to be drawn to such solutions as they are more accustomed to technology. Also, have a lower minimum investment requirement and better ease of access.

## Pooled investment
**Portfolio management process**, which can require the expertise of a portfolio manager, which **only wealthy individuals or institutions can afford**. **Retail investors with small amounts** to invest can turn to some pooled investment products provide an avenue for retail investors to enjoy the benefits of professionally managed portfolios **without needing a large sum of capital**.

Pooled investment vehicles are structures that combine the funds of many investors to build up a diversified portfolio of investments. Investors receive shares or units of the portfolio according to the amount they invested.

From the lowest to highest capital requirement:
- **Mutual funds**
- **Exchange-traded funds (ETF)**
- **Managed accounts** - ~$100,000 USD
- **Hedge funds** 
- **Private equity (PE)**

### Mutual funds
There are two types of mutual funds distribution model:
- **Open ended**
- **Closed ended**

The fee structure of mutual fund is the ongoing management of the portfolio assets, which is **expressed as a percentage of the net asset value of the fund**. 
On top of ongoing fees, there are two types of funding structure:
- **No-load funds** - do not charge additional fees
- **Load funds** - charge either upfront fees, redemption fees or both

#### Open-ended mutual fund
**Open ended mutual fund**:
- is a type of investment fund that **continuously issues and redeems shares based on investor demand**
- **does not have a fixed number of shares**, and investors can buy or sell shares **directly from the fund at the current net asset value (NAV)**, which is calculated at the end of each trading day. (i.e. the price is very close to NAV)
- the **fund company is responsible for issuing new shares when investors buy and redeeming shares** when investors sell
- is popular for their **liquidity** and **flexibility**, **allowing investors to enter or exit the fund at any time**.
- the **price** at which shares are bought or redeemed is based on the NAV per share, which is determined by dividing the total net assets of the fund by the total number of shares outstanding.

**Open-end mutual funds** market prices is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Price=\frac{Net\,asset\,value}{Num\,of\,outstanding\,shares}}$$
the price of **open-end mutual funds** usually **very close to NAV**.

#### Close-ended mutual fund
**Close-ended mutual fund**:
- **has a fixed number of shares issued through an initial public offering (IPO)**.
- once the shares are issued and the fund is launched, **the shares trade on stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets like regular stocks**.
- the fund company **does not continuously issue or redeem shares** based on investor demand (i.e. does not allow investor to redeem the shares back to the fund). Instead, **investors can buy or sell shares from other investors in the secondary market**.
- the price at which shares are traded in the secondary market is determined by supply and demand, and it **may differ from the underlying net asset value (NAV) of the fund**
- may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value due to market factors and investor sentiment, but usually as **at a discount** since there is **liquidity risk**

**Close-ended mutual funds** market prices is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Price\ne\frac{Net\,asset\,value}{Num\,of\,outstanding\,shares}}$$
Closed-end mutual funds usually trade at a significant discount to NAV to compensate investors for liquidity risks. **Prices deviate from NAV because it is market-driven**.

There are 5 types of mutual funds:
- **Money market mutual funds**
- Bond mutual funds
- Stock mutual

#### Money market funds
**Money market funds** are:
- with short-term maturity date (overnight to 90 days)
- invest in short term government like U.S. T-bills , corporate debt securities 
- fund net asset value (NAV) usually fluctuates very close to one dollar per share
- interest income is mostly passed on to the investors
- seen as very low risk securities
- sometimes regarded as cash equivalent as they are fairly liquid

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 23.11.39.png]]

#### Bond mutual funds 
**Bond mutual funds**: 
- invest in various types of fixed income securities with longer maturities from 1 year to up to 30 years
- they can be differentiated by issuers, credit ratings types and regions
- e.g. government bond funds, corporate funds, high yield bonds, inflation protection funds, tax free bonds, global bonds and emerging market bond funds

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 23.11.52.png]]

#### Stock mutual funds
Stock mutual funds are available in a great variety but mostly of two types:
- **Passively managed** index funds - match the performance of a particular index (e.g. S&P500)
- **Actively managed** - produce returns greater than a particular benchmark index.

**Actively managed** portfolio managers:
- select securities that are undervalued according to their valuation models
- management fees are higher (research and effort in security selection)
- higher turnover of portfolio securities in the attempts to produce higher returns
- greater tax liabilities (capital gains tax)

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 23.12.11.png]]


### ETFs
**ETFs** are closed-end funds where the shares are issued in the primary market and traded in secondary markets.

Unlike closed end mutual funds, their market price is actually quite close to the net asset value of the portfolio.

This is because ETFs have special provisions that allow some authorised participants to convert their shares into individual portfolio securities when the price is significantly below NAV or exchange of portfolio shares or ETF shares, when the price is significantly above NAV. Such activities help to keep the market price of the ETF close to the NAV per share of the portfolio.

**ETFs**, although closed-end, **have authorised participants** to help **moderate the market price**. The price is therefore not entirely market-driven.

### Open-end mutual funds vs. close-end ETFs summary 
![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 23.23.01.png]]

### Managed accounts (not a pooled investment)
A separately managed account is actually a portfolio that is owned by a single investor, usually an institution or wealthy individual.

No shares are issued as the single investor owns the entire account.

The account is managed by an individual investment professional who constructs the portfolio to meet the specific needs of the client in relation to his investment objectives, risk tolerance and tax situation.

Unlike pooled investments, the underlying assets are owned directly by the investor. The main disadvantage of a separately managed account is that the required minimum investment is usually much higher than a mutual fund.

Usually the minimum investment is at least $100000 dollars or more.

### Hedge funds
**Hedge funds** are pools of investor funds that are less regulated than mutual funds. There's a great variety of hedge fund strategies and major hedge fund categories are based on the investment strategy that the funds pursue.

#### Hedge funds strategies
#### Long/short funds
**Long/short funds** buy undervalued securities and sell overvalued securities at the same time when a long/short fund has a larger, long position relative to the short, it's said to have a long bias, if it is the other way, this is a short bias.

When the size of the long and short positions are intentionally maintained, roughly equal, it's a market neutral strategy. These ones are designed to be neutral with respect to overall market movements so that they can be profitable in both up and down markets as long as their longs outperform their shorts.

#### Fixed-income arbitrage funds
Fixed income arbitrage funds take long and short positions in debt securities to profit from minor mispricing. Interest rate risk is minimized because the long and short positions offset each other.

#### Convertible bond arbitrage funds 
**Convertible bond arbitrage funds** take a long position in a convertible bond and a simultaneous short position in the company's stock to profit from a relative mispricing between the two.

#### Event-driven
**Event driven funds** invest based on one time corporate events, like taking advantage of large price movements when mergers and acquisitions are announced.

#### Global macro funds
Global macro funds speculate on changes in international **interest rates** and **currency exchange rates**, often using derivative securities and a great amount of leverage.

### Private equity (PE) and Venture capital (VC)
Both **private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds** take significant equity positions in private companies, an essential feature is that they take very active roles in the management of the companies and have a strategy to exit the companies at higher valuations.

The main difference between the two is in the types of companies they invest in:
- **Leveraged buyout funds**:
	- buy entire public companies
	- take them private
	- funded with a significant increase in the firm's debt
	- reorganise firm and increase cash flow
	- increase the value of its equity
	- exit at higher valuation (sell the firm/IPO)
- **Venture capital funds**:
	- invest in start-ups
	- grow the company and increase the value
	- sell the firm/IPO
