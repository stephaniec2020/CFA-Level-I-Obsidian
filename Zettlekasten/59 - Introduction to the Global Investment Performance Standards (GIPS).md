## Introduction to Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)
### Why GIPS?
According to standard III (D): "**give fair, accurate and complete information**" - when making performance presentations, while GIPS as a recommended  but not compulsory tool that you can use to help you and your firm comply with the standard.

Several investment managers approach and present to her their track record of past performance which manager achieved the objectively better result before the establishment of a common standard.

This was close to impossible due to the various ways investment firms can misrepresent their results.

The three main types of misrepresentation are using:
- **representative accounts** - select a top-performing portfolio as representative of the firm‚Äôs results
- **survivorship bias** - exclusion of accounts that have been terminated (likely upward bias)
- **varying time periods** - only selection of time periods with better returns, which is not representative of long-term returns

GIPS is a set of ethical principles based on standardized, industry-wide approach to measuring performance. GIPS compliant annual returns have the complete and fairly presented track record, which enhances the credibility in the eyes of investors. Only investment management firms that actually manage assets can claim compliance with GIPS. Now, the investor can meaningfully compare performance and more confident from different firms.

### Objectives and key characteristics
**GIPS objectives**:
- establish investment industry **best practices for calculating and presenting** investment performance that promote investor interests and **instil investor confidence**.
- ensure consistent and accurate investment performance data in areas of **reporting**, **records**, **marketing** and **presentations**.
- **worldwide acceptance** of a single standard for the calculation and presentation of investment performance in a fair and comparable format with full disclosure
- Promote **fair, global competition** amongst investment firms without creating **barriers to entry**
- promote global **self-regulation**

**Key characteristics of GIPS**:
- compliance must be on **firm-wide** basis - definition of ‚Äòfirm‚Äô - should reflect the distinct business entity that is held out to the investment public, should include the global offices
- Firm must be **fully compliant** to GIPS
- compliant firm can use ‚ÄúThe xxx investment firm has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)‚Äù
- The only exception if the local laws are in conflict with GIPS in certain aspects, then the firms are to comply with local laws and which has to be stated and disclosed.

It cannot be claimed as only:
- a composite is compliant
- only the calculation methodology
- any other aspect that is not compliant - no partial compliant

### Composites
**Composite** is a grouping of individual discretionary portfolios representing a **similar investment strategy, objective, or mandate**.

All accounts included in a composite must be:
- Actual accounts (not simulated)
- Fee-paying (not free)
- Current and past (included all the terminated accounts)
- Discretionary portfolios (not client-directed)
- Managed according to the same investment mandate, objective or strategy
- Selection process should be done according to the pre-established criteria, not after the fact - selecte accounts for different composites at the beginning of the year and compute performance at the year end based on this list

### Verification requirements
The compliance with GIPS is purely voluntary, it is the responsibility of the firm to ensure and maintain the compliance. For better credibility, the firms are encouraged to pursue independent verification of compliance by the third party as firms cannot perform its own verification.

Verification must be on entire firm and not on specific composites, verifier does not ensure accuracy, but the 3rd party verifier can attest that:
- firm has complied with all GIPS requirements for composite construction on a firm-wide basis
- Firm‚Äôs processes and procedures are established to present performance in accordance with GIPS requirements
- upon verification, the firm can use ‚Äú[Name of firm] has been verified for the periods [dates] by [name of verifier]. A copy of the verification is available upon request.‚Äù
