## Analysing past and forecasting future performance

### Past Performance
The process typically starts with an evaluation of the past performance followed by building a forecasting model based on the findings of the evaluation, coupled with market projection to forecast the **future earnings** and **cash position** of the company.

Recall the financial statement analysis framework from the topic on financial analysis techniques. Evaluation of past performance has to do with Step 3 and 4, **processing** and **analyzing data**.

These include:
- common size analysis
- graphical analysis
- regression analysis
- ratio analysis

Studying the past performance of the company is usually done in the context of improving the forecasting model. With an understanding of the ratios, trends, and competitive advantage of the firm, an analyst can use these parameters as assumptions in estimating the future performance of the firm.

### Forecasting future
A forecast of **future net income** and **cash flow** often begins with **a forecast of future sales**. 

For a start, an analyst usually obtains a GDP forecast by outside research or an in-house economics group.  Historical relationships can be used to estimate the relationship between GDP growth and the growth of industry sales. In addition, some analysts may include their own projections of the firm's market share to obtain an even more precise forecast of the firm's future sales.

In some forecasting models, each item on an **income statement** and **balance sheet** can be estimated based on separate assumptions about its growth in relation to revenue growth. For multi-period forecast, an analyst typically employs a single estimate of sales growth at some point that is expected to continue indefinitely.

A first pass model might look something like this, where financing cash flows are omitted. The key items that are considered in this first pass are the increases in working capital and capital expenditures (CapEx) on new fixed assets.

The increase in working capital is essentially the change in non-cash working capital for the year. A typical assumption used is that non-cash working capital as a percentage of sales remains constant. To estimate pro forma cash flows, the analyst must make assumptions about future sources and uses of cash. The most important of these will be increases in working capital, capital expenditures on new fixed assets, issuance or repayments of debt, and issuance or repurchase of stock. A typical assumption is that noncash working capital will remain constant as a percentage of sales.

Another assumption we have here is that the fixed capital requirements remain at 10% of sales in each year. By subtracting the investment and working capital and investment in fixed capital from the net income, we have an estimate of the change in cash for each year.

This allows us to forecast the cash position of the company excluding the effects of financing cash flows and interest payments. So here, we see that the forecasted cash is increasing each year. This indicates a healthy cash position and that the company may not need to take on additional debt to sustain operations.

A second pass, which is outside the scope of this topic can be performed to model the effects of financing cash flows on the forecasted cash position.

## Credit quality assessment and equity screening
With the past performance and future forecast model, analysts can use these forecasts to assess the credit quality of a potential debt investment or to screen potential equity investments.

### Assess credit quality
An analyst has to assess the credit risk of the debt issuer. In essence, the ability of the issuer to meet the interest payment and principle repayment is evaluated.

Analysts often use the three Cs as a guideline, namely:
- **Character** - **track record** of the company in making payments, management's professional **reputation**
- **Capacity** - ability to meet debt obligations when due, examine **financial statement** and **ratios**
- **Collateral** - quality of assets offered to secure loans, reduce risk to lender

#### Credit rating agencies 
Credit rating agencies include:
- Moody's
- S&P
- Fitch

Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by both S&P and Fitch are considered as non-investment grade, high-yield junk bond. It is an important distinction as some institutions are prohibited in investing in non-investment grades bonds.

and they rate firms through generally 4 broad categories:
- **Scale and diversification** - company size, product lines, geographical markets
- **Operational efficiency** - ROA, operating margin, EBITDA margin, vertical diversification
- **Margin stability** - variability of profitability margins
- **Leverage** - interest coverage ratio (e.g. EBITDA/interest expense)

![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 03.40.30.png]]

>Margin stability is desirable from the lender's perspective for both floating-rate and fixed-rate debt. Higher volatility will increase credit risk. Product and geographic diversification should lower credit risk as the borrower is less sensitive to adverse events and conditions.

### Equity screening
When it comes to screening for potential equity investments a portfolio manager usually has an investment strategy to narrow down the list from the large universe of potential equity investments.

The objective is usually to select **growth**, **value** or **income** stocks.

Value stocks are considered to be those that have low prices relative to earnings (or relative to sales, cash flow, or book value). Screens that exclude firms with low earnings growth rates or high dividend payout ratios are more likely to be used to identify growth stocks.

Criteria, however, are seldom used in isolation. Multiple criteria are used because a screen based on a single factor can include firms with other undesirable characteristics.

In addition to requiring a low PE ratio, an analyst may look at the debt levels to determine if the high earnings are due to high leverage (use of debt). So, in this case, the screen is further narrowed down when we exclude firms with a high debt to equity ratio.

**Stock screening with ratios**
1. Start with defined universe of stocks
2. Filter by ratios (e.g. stocks with P/E ratio < X)
3. Filter resulting list further with more ratios (e.g. stock with dividend yield > y)
**Goal:** Manageable list of stocks for detailed analysis

Financial statement measures identify firm characteristics, and if screen includes stocks with undesirable characteristics, can add ratios to screen. However, there are many ratios that are typically high or low for most firms in an industry. For example, screen for high dividends, low P/B ratio would over-represent financial firms.

## Adjusting financial statements for comparability
Financial statements can only be compared when the companies are using the same standard and same accounting method. However, most often it's not the case. Analyst has to adjust the financial statement first before comparison.

### Adjustments to facilitate comparison between companies
There are different adjustments to be made before comparing between companies:
- Investment in securities
- Inventory accounting
- Depreciation method and estimates
- Intangible assets

In addition, analyst must adjust for the difference in reporting standard bodies accounting principles.

#### Investment in securities
Although the 3 companies: company A, company B and company C are holding onto the same securities, due to accounting method, the financial reports and ratios can differ.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 14.53.23.png]]

In addition, there is one difference between IFRS and US GAAP.

Unrealized gains and losses that result from exchange rate fluctuations on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded on the income statement under IFRS, but not US GAAP.

An analyst should adjust such items from the income statement when comparing firms that report under different standards.

### Inventory accounting
A firm which uses LIFO accounting method will have a higher COGS than using FIFO in an inflationary environment. Therefore, the firms that uses LIFO must report the **LIFO reserve**, which is the amount by which the LIFO inventory is less than the FIFO inventory. This value allows analysts to make financial statements prepared under LIFO comparable to those of FIFO firms.

The LIFO method creates:
- higher COGS
- low inventory
- low net income
- low income tax

The FIFO method creates:
- low COGS
- high inventory
- high net income
- high income tax

#### Conversion of FIFO statement to LIFO statement:
1. Add LIFO reserve to the LIFO inventory
2. Deduct ***cash*** = LIFO reserve $\times$ Tax rate; where ***cash*** is the additional cash balance from paying less taxes
3. On the other side, analyst has to adjust the retained earnings on the other side of the balance sheet: RE = LIFO Reserve $\times$ (1-Tax rate) to retained earnings
4. LIFO COGS = LIFO COGS - $\Delta$ LIFO reserves (i.e. ending LIFO Reserve - beginning LIFO reserve)

LIFO ending inventory can be adjusted to a FIFO basis by adding the LIFO reserve, which a firm using LIFO must disclose in the notes to its financial statements.

> Patch Grove Nursery uses the LIFO inventory accounting method. Maria Huff, president, wants to determine the financial statement impact of changing to the FIFO accounting method. Selected company information follows:
> 
> -   Year-end inventory: $22,00
> -   LIFO reserve: $4,000
> -   Change in LIFO reserve: $1,000
> -   LIFO cost of goods sold: $18,000
> -   After-tax income: $2,000
> -   Tax rate: 40%
> - 
> Under FIFO, the nursery's ending inventory and after-tax profit for the year would have been:
> FIFO ending inventory: $26,000 and FIFO after-tax profit: $2,600
> FIFO ending inventory = LIFO ending inventory + LIFO reserve = 22,000 + 4,000 = $26,000
> FIFO after-tax profit = LIFO after-tax profit + (change in LIFO reserve)(1 â€“ t) = $2,000 + ($1,000)(1 â€“ 0.4) = $2,000 + $600 = $2,600

### Depreciation methods and estimates
Adjustment for depreciation, on the other hand, is not a straightforward. This is because disclosures related to depreciation are often not specific enough.

Depreciation methods, residual value of depreciable asset and useful life of depreciable asset can lead to significant differences in reported income and balance sheet values depending on the accounting biases (conservative vs. aggressive bias).

The firm adopting aggressive bias will report higher income and higher balance sheet net asset values given the impression of better financials and better ratios. If an analyst has reason to conclude that such aggressive accounting is practiced, analyst can make an adjustment to the firm's net income and fixed asset carrying values to make the figures and ratios more comparable to its peers.

### Intangible asset
Intangible assets are also a major area of adjustment by analysts. As per accounting rules, tangible assets are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation for company A. Company B records the assets at fair value as of the acquisition date.

Recall this chart that we've discussed earlier. Since the costs to develop intangible assets are generally recorded as expense and there are no goodwill, company A which grown organically do not have those, whereas the company which grown by acquiring businesses, it has identifiable intangible assets at fair value at acquisition date, and goodwill (acquisition price - fair value of acquired assets) will have inflated assets compare to company A.

The book value per share (BVPS) equation is as following:
$$\mathrm{BVPS=\frac{Assets-liabilities-Goodwill}{\#\,of\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
where the goodwill is subtracted when calculating ratios to compare companies that grown by acquiring businesses vs. grown organically.

The tangible book value per share (BVPS) equation is as following:
$$\mathrm{BVPS=\frac{Assets-liabilities-Goodwill-Intangible\,assets}{\#\,of\,shares\,outstanding}}$$
where both the goodwill and intangible assets are subtracted when calculating ratios to compare companies that grown by acquiring businesses vs. grown organically.

## Some analyst examples 

>Portsmouth Industries has stated that in the market for their medical imaging product, their strategy is to grow their market share in the premium segment by leveraging their research and development capabilities to produce machines with greater resolution for the most challenging cases of spinal degeneration. An analyst examining their financials for subsequent periods wouldÂ _most likely_Â conclude that they are successfully pursuing this strategy if she finds: an increase in gross margins greater than the increase in operating margins.
>
>A shift to premium, rather than commodity-like, products should result in higher gross margins, higher average revenue per unit (selling price per unit), and an increase in gross margins relative to operating margins (because of the increase in R&D and marketing expenditures). A successful shift to a premium product should increase operating margins rather than increase operating income through increased unit sales. Revenue would not necessarily increase as the company shifted to premium products.

> TheÂ _most likely_Â problem with using financial statement ratios to screen for stocks to include in a portfolio is that: specific industries are often over-represented.
> 
> It is often the case a screening metric, such as low P/E, high dividend yield, or high ROE, will identify many stocks in the same industry. Undesirable characteristics can be avoided by including additional screening metrics. Financial statement measures provide a great amount of information about a firm's characteristics.

>For 2007, Morris Company had 73 days of inventory on hand. Morris would like to decrease its days of inventory on hand to 50. Morris' cost of goods sold for 2007 was $100 million. Morris expects cost of goods sold to be $124.1 million in 2008. Assuming a 365 day year, compute the impact on Morris' operating cash flow of theÂ _change_Â in average inventory for 2008. 
>
>$3.0 million source of cash.
>
>2007 inventory turnover was 5 (365 / 73 days in inventory). Given inventory turnover and COGS, 2007 average inventory was $20 million ($100 million COGS / 5 inventory turnover). 2008 inventory turnover is expected to be 7.3 (365 / 50 days in inventory). Given expected inventory turnover, 2008 average inventory is $17 million ($124.1 million COGS / 7.3 expected inventory turnover). To achieve 50 days of inventory on hand, average inventory must decline $3 million ($20 million 2007 average inventory â€“ $17 million 2008 expected inventory). A decrease in inventory is a source of cash.
