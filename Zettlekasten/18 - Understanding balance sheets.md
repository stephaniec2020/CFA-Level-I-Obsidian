## Components and format of the balance sheet

### Accounting Equation
The basic accounting equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Assets = Liabilities +Contributed\,capital+Retained\,earnings}$$

### Balance sheet
**Balance sheet** is a snapshot of the **company's financial position at a given time**, and it consists of 3 elements:
- **Asset** - resources that are expected to provide future benefits and are controlled as a result of past transactions (including cash)
- **Liability** - obligations resulting from past events that are expected to require a future outflow of resources (i.e. amount owed to creditors or lenders)
- **Owner's equity** - residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities (i.e. owner's claim the portion of asset after deducting the liability)
The statement of the company's asset, liabilities and equity at a given time.

The most basic equation for the balance sheet:
$$\mathrm{Asset=Liability+Equity}$$
where the firm's asset is funded by liabilities (through creditors), and equities (through equity investors/owner's of the firm).

Relationship between cash and asset/liabilities
There are some thumb rules, if asset up - cash goes down, as the company has to pay, if the liabilities go up, then the cash goes up.

## Current and non-current assets and liabilities
The **current and non-current assets and liabilities** are classified as those depending on their expected time frames.
- **Current** assets or liabilities refers to the period of 1 year or 1 operating year. (e.g. account receivables - cash that the customers owes you)
- **Non-current** assets or liabilities refers to the period beyond 1 year or beyond 1 operating year.

## Assets
**Asset is that is going to give future benefits to the company that it owns.**
- **Assets** includes cash and instruments that can be converted to cash.
- There are two types of asset within the company:
	- Current assets
	- Non-current assets
- **Current asset**:
	**Assets** likely to be converted to cash or used up within period (normally within a year), which is also known as short-term assets, which include:
	- **Cash and cash equivalents** - *this is the most important bit, by balancing the cash, asset, liabilities, and equity*
	- Marketable securities (invested in shares that they would like to share)
	- Account receivable
	- Inventories
	- Other current assets (e.g. pre-paid rents)
	- The items are usually presented in the order of liquidity
	- It can provide the information of the **firm's operating activities**
- **Non-current asset**:
	- Do not meet the definition of current assets (will give future benefits or converted cash after 12 months), which include:
	- Plant, property, and equipment
	- Investment property
	- Intangible assets (e.g. licenses, trademarks, copyrights)
	- Goodwill
	- Financial assets
	- It provides information of the **firm's investing activities**


## Liabilities
- **Future obligations that the company needs to fulfil,** there are two types of liabilities within the company:
	- Current liabilities 
	- Non-current liabilities
- **Current liabilities (next 12 months)**:
	They are obligations expected to be satisfied within period.
	- Liabilities held primarily for trading purposes.
	- No-unconditional right to defer settlement for more than a year
	The **current liabilities** include:
	- Accounts payable (i.e. buying from suppliers on credit, what company owes to suppliers)
	- Notes payable (i.e. liabilities that indicate the money a company owes its financiers)
	- Accrued liabilities
	- Unearned revenue (i.e. cash collected in advance of providing goods and services, e.g. magazine subscription services)
- **Non-current liabilities**:
	Do not meet the definition of current liabilities, which include:
	- Long-term financial liabilities 
	- Differed tax liabilities
	- It provides **long-term financing activities**

## Owner's equity
- **Owner's equity** include:
	- Contributed capital
	- Retained earnings
	- Treasury stock
	- Accumulated OCI

## Balance sheet analysis
- When analysing the balance sheet, we can assess the firm's liquidity level, ability to pay dividends and solvency.
- **Liquidity** is the ability to meet **short term obligations**. (Understand through current)
- **Solvency** is the ability to meet **long term obligations**. (Understand through non-current)

The formula for understanding liquidity:
$$\mathrm{Current\,asset = Current\,liabilities + Working\,capital}$$
where the working capital indicates the liquidity state (whether the company is working at a healthy liquidity level or not).
- When there is not enough working capital â‡’ **liquidity problems**
- When there is too much working capital â‡’ **inefficient use of assets**

## Presentation and format of the balance sheet
- Some of the companies used **classified balance sheet**, which clearly defines the current and non-current assets and liabilities, which is under the guidance of US GAAP
- Some companies (most banks/financial institutes) use **liquidity-based balance sheet**, which is required by the IFRS, it does not have the separation of current or not-current asset/liabilities, instead it lists all assets and liabilities in order of liquidity (this format is typically more relevant and reliable than a classified balance sheet)
- **Operating cycle** refers to the time it takes to turn raw materials into cash from sales.

## Book value
- **Book value**
- Value recorded in the balance sheet should not be interpreted as market value or intrinsic value
- Asset values can be reported at:
	- Historical cost
	- Amortised cost
	- Fair value
- Some assets which are of value are not reported:
	- Brand recognition
	- Workforce

## Current assets
- **Current assets** are cash + assets that will be converted to cash within 1 year or 1 operating cycle, which include:
	- Cash and cash equivalents
	- Marketable securities
	- Account receivable
	- Inventories
	- Other current assets (deferred taxed assets)

### Cash and cash equivalents
- Short-term, highly liquid investment readily convertible to cash
- Interest rate risk is insignificant
- e.g. Treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds
- Reported at **amortised cost** or at **fair value**

### Marketable securities
- Traded in a **public market**
- Value can be readily determined
- e.g. Treasury notes, bonds, and equity securities
- Recorded at **amortised cost** or **fair value**

### Accounts receivable
- Amounts owed to the company by customers for goods and services **sold on credit**, therefore it is not yet in cash, but it is an asset line item
- Reported at **net realisable value**, taking into account an estimated bad debt expense, which includes the accounts that are doubtful to pay and realise it, the equation is as follows:
 $$\mathrm{Account\,receivables = Gross\,receivables - Allowance\,for\, doubtful\,accounts}$$
- The company is required to disclose concentrations of **credit risk**
- Analyse
	- Receivables vs sales â‡’ reveal collection problems
	- Allowance for doubtful accounts vs. level and growth rate of sales â‡’ reveal underestimation of bad debts

### Inventories
The **inventories** include:
- Raw materials
- Work-in-process
- Finished goods

Included the costs listed below:
- Purchase cost
- Conversion cost
- Cost to bring inventory to current conditions

Excluded costs:
- Abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour and overheads
- Storage costs (Unless it's part of the production)
- Admin overhead
- Selling cost

Measurement of **costs**:
- **Standard costing (manufacturing)** - assigning **predetermined amounts** of materials, labour, and overhead to goods produced
- **Retail method** - $\mathrm{Cost = Retail\,value - Gross\,margin}$
- Under IFRS, inventory is reported at lower of **cost** or **net realisable value (NRV)**: 
- The equation of **Net realisable value (NRV)** is:
$$\mathrm{NRV = Estimated\,selling\,price-Estimated\,cost\,of\,completion-Selling\,cost}$$
 - Under US GAAP, inventory is reported at lower of **cost** or **market value**:
 - **Market value** normally equals to the replacement cost, it cannot be greater than the net realisable value or lesser than the profit margin
 - Market value is usually replacement value. However, it should not be more than NRV, or less than (NRV-profit margin). If replacement value > NRV, we should use NRV under US GAAP.

![[Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 14.19.04.png]]
> Inventories are valued on the balance sheet at the lower of **cost** or **net realisable value**. Net realisable value is equal to $3,150,000 ($3,500,000 selling price â€“ $300,000 completion costs â€“ $50,000 disposal costs). Since the original cost of $3,200,000 exceeds the net realisable value of $3,150,000, a $50,000 write-down is necessary. An inventory write-down has no impact on the quick ratio since inventory is excluded from both the numerator and denominator of the quick ratio.

### Other current assets
- **Other current assets** may not be material and they may be shown separately.
- e.g. prepaid expenses
- **Prepaid expenses** are operating costs that have been paid in advance

## Current liabilities
**Current liabilities** are obligations that will be satisfied within 1 year or 1 operating cycle, which include:
- Accounts payable (i.e. buying from suppliers by credit, what company owes to suppliers)
- Notes payable
- Accrued liabilities
- Unearned revenue (i.e. cash collected in advance of providing goods and services)

### Accounts payable
- **Accounts payable**, also known as trade payables, are amounts the firm owes to suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit
- High accounts payable relative to purchases can signal credit problems

### Notes payable 
- **Notes payable** are obligations in the form of promissory notes owed to creditors and lenders
- It is considered as financing cash flow under the cash flow statement
- The current portion of long-term debt is the principal portion of debt due within one year of operating cycle, whichever is greater

### Accrued liabilities
- Expenses that have been recognised in the income statement but have not yet been paid as for the balance sheet date (i.e. not contractually due)
- It result from the accrual method of accounting, under which expenses are recognised as incurred
- e.g. Income taxes payable, accrued interest payable, accrued warranty costs, wages payable

### Unearned revenue
- Cash collected in advance of providing goods and services

## Non-current assets
- **Non-current assets** are assets other than current assets, also known as long-lived assets.
- It can be subdivided in: tangible (physical), intangible, and financial assets, which include:
	- Plant, properties and equipments
	- Investment property
	- Intangible assets
	- Goodwill
	- Financial assets

### Plant, property and equipment (PP&E)
- Tangible assets used in the production of goods and services
- Includes: Land and buildings, machine and equipments, furniture and natural resources
- Nearly all of the tangible assets depreciate over time, except for land because it has a indefinite life
- It can be calculated through cost model or revaluation model
- Under IFRS PP&E can be reported using the **cost model** or the **revaluation model**.
- Under US GAAP, only the **cost model** is allowed.

#### Cost model:
$$\mathrm{Amortised\,cost=Historical\,cost -Accumulated\,(Depreciation,Amortisation,Depletion,Impairment)}$$
which has been described in detail in the straight-line method, double declining balance method of cost calculation; **Historical cost** includes the purchase, delivery or installation cost

> **Q**: On 1 Jan 2014, a company bought a machine at a cost of $100,000.  At the point of purchase, the company determined that the machine shall be depreciated using the straight line method, with a depreciation expense of $10,000 per year. On 1 Jan 2017, the company realises that the recoverable amount for the machine is $50,000.  Under the cost model, how should the company report for this machine on its balance sheet and income statement for 1 Jan 2017?

> **A**: Under straight-line depreciation, the company should have accumulated depreciation of $30,000 for 2014 to 2016. Â That leaves a carrying value of $70,000 in the balance sheet on 1 Jan 2017. However, recoverable amount is now $50,000. Â The carrying value should be written down to $50,000 on the balance sheet, and report a loss of $20,000 in the income statement.

#### Impairment
**Impairment** is an asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the **recoverable amount**

##### Recoverable amount 
- Under IFRS, the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of fair value less any selling costs, or the asset's **value in use**.
- Greater of **fair value** i.e. selling cost
- **Value in use** is the present value of the asset's future cash flow stream
- If impaired, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount and a **loss** is recognised in the income statement
- **Note:** Loss recovery are allowed under IFRS but not under US GAAP.
- Asset new carrying value = recoverable amount, and the asset will be written down on the balance sheet that the company owns it

### Intangible assets
#### Identifiable 
- Acquired separately or rights conveyed through ownership
- Can be purchased or created internally
- e.g. Patents, trademarks, copyrights

#### Purchased intangible assets
- It can be use the cost model or the revaluation model
$$\mathrm{Amortised\,cost = Historical\,cost - Accumulated \,amortisation}$$
- **Finite-lived** - amortised over their useful lives, it is reviewed at least annually
- **Infinite life** - not amortised but tested for impairment
- The revaluation model can only be used if an active market for the intangible asset exists

### Internally created intangible assets
**Internally created intangible assets** is difficult to put a realised cost.

Therefore, under both IFRS and US GAAP, the general requirement is to put it under expense rather than report on the balance sheet, except R&D:
  - Internally generated brands, publishing titles, customer lists etc.
  - Start-up costs
  - Training costs
  - Administrative and other general overhead costs
  - Advertising and promotion
  - Relocation and reorganisation expenses
  - Redundancy and other termination costs

#### Special treatment for R&D
- Under IFRS, the company **must split** the cost of **research** phase and **development** phase in R&D
- **Research phase** - seek new knowledge or product â‡’ it has to be **expense under the income statement**
- **Development phase** - design or testing prototypes â‡’ it can be **capitalised as intangible asset under balance sheet** (e.g. technologically feasible, able to use or sell the asset, able to complete)
- Under US GAAP, R&D are all considered under expensed.

#### Unidentifiable
- Not acquired separately and may have **unlimited life**, therefore they are not amortised
- e.g. Goodwill
- **Goodwill** is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business acquisition (accounting goodwill), the acquires are often willing to pay more than the fair value of the target's identifiable net assets because the target may have assets that are not reported on its balance sheet; part of the acquisition price may reflect perceived synergies from business combination
	  - e.g. target's reputation and customer loyalty certainly have value, however the value is not quantifiable
	  - it is different from the economic goodwill, which is derived from expected future performance
	  - Internally is expense as incurred 
- **Infinite life** - not amortised but tested for impairment, and is reviewed at least annually
- If it is impaired, it is recognised as loss on in the income statement
- The impairment loss does not affect cash flow.
- As long as the goodwill is not impaired, can remain in the balance sheet forever. 

The good will equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Goodwill = Purchase\,price - Fair\,value\,of\,net\,assets\,acquired}$$

> **Q**: ACQ Corp paid $20 million cash to fully acquire its key supplier SUB Corp. At the point of acquisition, SUBâ€™s net assets was $17 million.  ACQ independently assessed the plant, property and equipment of SUB to be $1 million higher than reported by SUB. How much goodwill, if any, should ACQ report on its balance sheet from this acquisition exercise?

> **A**: Fair value of net assets of SUB = $17 + $1 = $18 million; Goodwill = Acquisition price â€“ Fair value of subsidiary = $20M â€“ $18M = $2M

- Since goodwill is not amortised, firms can manipulate net income upward by allocating more of the acquisition price to goodwill and less to identifiable assets â‡’ the result is less depreciation and amortisation expense, resulting in higher net income
- When comparing ratios, analysts should eliminate goodwill from the balance sheet and goodwill impairment charges from the income statement for comparability
- Analyst should also evaluate future acquisitions in terms of the price paid relative to the earning power of the acquired assets.

### Financial assets
**Financial assets** include debt, equity, derivatives, loans, and notes receivable which a company holds of other companies or institutions

There are 3 methods of accounting:
  - **Cost or amortised cost**
  - **Fair value (through profit and loss)**
  - **Fair value (through other comprehensive income OCI)**

#### Cost or amortised cost
- No reliable market value
- Intend to hold to maturity
- No reporting of unrealised gain/losses
	  - e.g. Loans/notes receivable - value at cost (no fair market value), 
	  - unquoted equity valued at cost (no-fair value on market)
	  - debt - valued at amortised cost if intents hold to maturity

#### Fair value (through profit and loss)
- Reliable market value
- Intend to profit over near term
- Unrealised gains/losses are reported in the income statement
	- e.g. stocks/equities, 
	- derivatives, 
	- debt - valued through PnL if intent is to trade for a profit

#### Fair value (through OCI)
- Reliable market value
- No intention to hold to maturity or trade for profit
- Unrealised gains/losses are reported in the other comprehensive income
	- e.g. **equities**, **allow irrevocable choice** at time of purchase and not allowed to change over time **(fair value of equity securities, report through either profit and loss or other comprehensive income (OCI) under IFRS)**
	- **debt** - if intent is to collect interest but sell before maturity

### Overview of how financial assets can be written through different methods of accounting
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.18.27.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.20.56.png]]

### Terminology for US GAAP
US GAAP has terms for all three types of financial debt:
- **Held-to-maturity**
- **Available-for-sale**
- **Trading**

### Example of how to account on the financial asset
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.21.16.png]]
- Available-for-sale financial assets should be reported at fair value in the balance sheet, and any unrealised gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income.
- Dividends received from trading securities and available-for-sale securities are recognized in the income statement. The difference in trading and available-for-sale classifications relates to the treatment of any unrealised gains and losses.

>1 year ago, a manufacturing company bought 100,000 shares of a key supplier at $5 per share.  The shares were reported as available-for-sale.  During the year, a cash dividend of $0.30 per share was distributed.
>
>Today, the market price of the shares are trading at $4 per share.  How should the company report these shares in its financial statements?
>
> Value in balance sheet: $400,000 Income statement: +$30,000 (gain) Other comprehensive income: -$100,000 (loss)
> 
> Available-for-sale financial assets should be reported at fair value in the balance sheet, and any unrealised gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income. 
> 
> Balance sheet carrying value = $400,000
> Unrealised loss of $100,000 in OCI
> $30,000 gain from dividend in income statement

### Non-current liabilities 
**Non-current liabilities** are liabilities other than current liabilities, also known as long-term liabilities, and the types of long-term financial liabilities: 
  - Bank loans
  - Notes payable
  - Bonds payable
  - Derivatives
- Notes payable and bonds payable -> reported at **amortised cost**
- Held-for-trading liabilities, derivatives liabilities â‡’ reported at **fair value**
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.23.12.png]]

- **Deferred tax liabilities** is tax that has been assessed for the current period but has not yet been paid, it can be caused by two reasons:
â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Timing differences (Accrual and payment differences)
â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Accounting differences (e.g. accelerated depreciation for tax purpose)

### Deferred tax liabilities
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.22.18.png]]

## Owner's Equity 
The balance sheet's equity items should have all the income sheet line items, i.e. Revenue, COGS, SG&A, R&D, and other expenses. Also, it includes the depreciation expense, amortisation expense, and interest expense.

**Owner's equity** is the residual interest of asset subtracted from the liabilities, it includes: 
- Contributed capital
- Treasury stock
- Preferred stock
- Retained earnings
- Accumulated OCI
- Minority interest

Companies are required to disclose the number of common shares which are authorised, issued, and outstanding.

### Common shares
There are 3 types of common shares:
- **Authorised** - Number of shares that **may be** sold that can be sold under the article of incorporation
- **Issued** - Number of actual shares actually sold
- **Outstanding** - $\mathrm{Issued\,shares - Reacquired\,shares}$

Shares can be distributed at par value (i.e. stated value at issuance) or with a premium. 

The **par value of common stock:
- is the **stated or nominal value assigned to the stock**
- par value has **no relationship to market value**.
- The **amount the corporation receives from the issuance of common stock is equal to the par value plus the additional paid-in-capital (proceeds in excess of par)**

### Contributed capital
**Contributed capital** is the amount of capital contributed by the common shareholders, which is the number of shares multiply the cost of common shareholders acquired at issuance.

The **contributed capital** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Contributed\,capital = Number\,of\,shares \times Value\,of\,each\,share}$$
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.27.21.png]]

### Treasury stock
- **Treasury stock** is when the company decided to **buy back from the common shareholders**, those stocks belong to the treasury stock, **reacquired and not yet retired**
- Treasury stock **do not have voting rights and no dividends**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.27.07.png]]

### Preferred stock
**Preferred stock** is also a part of contributed capital, where the asset is cash and equity in the equal amount on company's balance sheet.

- **Preferred stock** have certain rights and privileges that are not conferred by the common stock (i.e. paid dividends at a specified rate, normally presented as a percentage at par value, have priority over the claims of the common shareholders in the event of liquidation)
- It can be classified as debt instead of equity
 
### Retained earning
- The net income from the income statement can be distributed to common shareholders as dividends
- The balance of the dividends goes into **retained earnings**, retained earnings are the earnings that have not been distributed to the common shareholders
- **Note:** Cash dividends do not affect contributed capital.
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.36.41.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.36.59.png]]

### Accumulated OCI
- **Other comprehensive income** include the unrealised gains and losses in securities 
- The **gains or losses in securities** are not going to be reflected in the income statement, instead, it'll be **on the balance sheet under owner's equity**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.39.22.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.39.39.png]]

### Minority interest
- In the case of a parent acquiring majority stake in a subsidiary, the entire net assets of the subsidiary goes into the parentâ€™s balance sheet. Â The portion that does not belong to the parent is recorded as minority interest under ownersâ€™ equity.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.41.44.png]]

## Statement of changes in stockholder's equity

The **statement of changes in stockholder's equity** summaries all the transactions that increase or decrease the equity accounts for a period, which includes payments of dividends and comprehensive income.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 10.46.54.png]]

## Balance sheet analysis
**Balance sheet analysis** can understands the company's liquidity and solvency, and the economic resources that the company controls

For comparisons between company, often convert into ratios:
- Liquidity ratio
- Solvency ratio

### Liquidity ratio
**Liquidity ratio** is the ability to satisfy **short-term** obligations, whether the liquid assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory) can satisfy the current liabilities (due within a year). 

There are 3 ways to assess the company's liquidity (liquidity ratio):
- **Current ratio**
- **Quick ratio**
- **Cash ratio**

The **current ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Current\,ratio = \frac{Current\,assets}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
where current assets include inventory, cash, marketable securities, and receivables.

The **quick ratio** is as follows:$$\mathrm{Quick\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities+Receivables}{Current\,liabilities}}$$where inventory is excluded from the equation since it is not easy to solve whether it is current or not.

Stricter ratio which excludes receivables as well, the **cash ratio** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,ratio = \frac{Cash+Marketable\,securities}{Current\,liabilities}}$$
![[Screenshot 2023-05-11 at 16.15.54.png|150]] ![[Screenshot 2023-05-11 at 16.16.27.png|150]]![[Screenshot 2023-05-11 at 16.17.15.png|150]]


### Solvency ratio
**Solvency ratio** is the ability to satisfy **long-term** obligations.
There are 4 ways of measuring **solvency (solvency ratio)**:
- Long-term Debt-to-Equity
- Total Debt-to-Equity
- Debt ratio
- Financial leverage

**Long-term Debt-to-Equity** equation is as follows:$$\mathrm{LT\,Debt\,to\,Equity = \frac{LT\,Debt}{Total\,equity}}$$
**Total Debt-to-Equity** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,Debt\,to\,Equity = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,equity}}$$

**Debt ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,ratio = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,assets}}$$

**Financial leverage equation** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Financial\,leverage = \frac{Total\,debt}{Total\,equity}}$$

where if the item is balance sheet item, use the average value (i.e. average of two accounting period).

### Common size statement
- **Common size statement** can be prepared just like the income statement
- It is presented as a percentage of **total assets**
- It can again be used with the cross-section analysis and time-series analysis
