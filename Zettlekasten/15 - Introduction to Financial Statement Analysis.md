## Scope of financial statement analysis
- Provide information about company's performance, **financial position**, and changes in financial position
- Past reports can form expectations about the company's ability to earn profits and generate cash flow in the future
- Usually conducted analysis for investment (should I buy?), credit (should I lend?) or other economic decision (should I recommend?) purposes
- Financial reports are released in regular time intervals depending on the regulatory requirements:
	- Quarterly
	- Semi-quarterly
	- Annually

## Major financial statements
There are 5 types of major financial statements:
- Balance sheet 
- Income statement
- Statement of comprehensive income
- Change in equity 
- Cash flows

### Accounting Equation

$$\mathrm{Assets = Liabilities +Contributed\,capital+Retained\,earnings}$$
$$\mathrm{Equity = Contributed\,capital+Retained\,earnings}$$

**Assets**: Resources owned and employed by an organisation which confer future economic benefits.
**Liabilities**: Money owed, or other financial obligations to other organisations and individuals.
**Contributed capital**: Capital employed represents the funds provided to an organisation in the form of equity or debt.
**Retained earnings**: The profits retained by an organisation after all expenses including interest expenses, taxes and dividends. The retained profits / earnings for a given year are reinvested in the business (hopefully making the organisation grow, and increasing the value of its shares) and are added to â€˜retained earningsâ€™ in the balance sheet (which represent all retained profits accumulated over an organisationâ€™s entire life to date which have been reinvested in the business).

### Balance sheet
Balance sheet can be a snapshot of the company's financial position, and it consists of 3 elements:
- Asset (Resources controlled by the firm - including cash)
- Liability (Amount owed to creditors or lenders)
- Owner's equity (Owner's claim the portion of asset after deducting the liability)

The balance sheet is a â€˜snapshotâ€™ of an organisationâ€™s assets and liabilities on a particular date. The balance sheet shows the sources of funds provided to an organisation (called the capital employed and normally either equity or debt) and how those funds have been used by the organisation to invest in fixed assets (assets the organisation intends to keep for more than one year) and working capital (money tied up in the day to day operations of the business).


$$\mathrm{Equity = Asset - Liability}$$

### Income statement (Profit and Loss statement)
- Income statement explains the net income of the company, which is the company's financial performance over a reporting period
$$\mathrm{Revenue - Expenses + Other\,Income = Net\,income}$$
- **Revenues** are inflows from delivering or producing goods, rendering services or other activities that constitute the firm's central operations
- **Expenses** are outflows in the process of running these operations, depreciation of assets and incurrence of liabilities that decrease equity
- **Other income** are gains that may or may not arise in the ordinary course of business


### Statement of comprehensive income
**Other comprehensive income** are gains and losses that are excluded from the income statement, so do not confuse with the **other income from the income statement**
- Examples of other comprehensive incomes are:
	- Unrealised gains and losses from investments that are available for sale
	- Foreign currency exchange gains or losses
	- Pension plans gains or losses

$$\mathrm{Total\,comprehensive\,income =Net\,income + Other\,comprehensive \,income}$$

- Firms can choose to report a single total comprehensive income or 2 individual reports of net income and other comprehensive income

### Change in equity
- Shareholders transactions
- If dividends are paid out, it changes in the equity.
- Net change in equity should be reported in the change of equity.

### Cash flows
- Since company's own a lot of cash, it 
- Disclosure of the sources and the uses of the cash.
- It helps investors or analyst to understand the company's liquidity, solvency and financial flexibility (which is also the company's financial performance over a reporting period).
- Cash flows are segregated into 3 segments, and summation of all of those are net cash flow:
	- CF from Operation (Cash effects of transactions that involve the normal business of the firm)
	- CF from Investment (Resulting from the purchase or sale of long-term assets, such as property)
	- CF from Financing (From activities related to obtaining or repaying capital)
$$\mathrm{CF (Operation)+CF(Investments)+CF(Financing) =Net\,CF}$$
where CF: cash flow.

## Footnotes
- Footnotes are required 
- It is to disclose any additional information about the items presented.
- Sometimes it allows the analyst to have in-depth analysis from footnotes:
	- **Basis of preparation** - clarification of the fiscal period covered, inclusion of consolidated entities
	- **Accounting method, assumption and estimates** used by the management
	- **Additional material information** - business acquisitions or disposals, legal actions, employee benefit plans, contingencies and commitments, significant customers, sales to related parties, segments of the firm, contingent losses (lawsuits)

## Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)
- also known as **management's commentary**
- Nature of the business
- Past performance (Trends)
- Future outlook (Significant events/Uncertainties)
- Effects of inflation/changing in prices
- Off-balance sheet obligations and contractual obligations (purchase commitments)
- Accounting policies that require significant management judgement

- It is ***recommended*** under **IFRS** of addressing company's key relationships, resources and risks,  as well as nature of the business, management objectives, the company's past performance, and the performance measured used.
- Securities regulators may impose requirements for publicly traded company to address certain topics but accounting standards do not.
