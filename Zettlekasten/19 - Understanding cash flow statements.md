## Fundamental principles
### Statement of cash flows
- Since the income statement is based on accrual method, the net income may not represent cash generated from operations
- A company may be generating positive and growing net income but may be headed for insolvency because insufficient cash is being generated from operating activities
- Constructing a statement of cash flows is an important aspect for analysis of firm's activities and prospects, for example:
	- Understand whether regular operations generate enough cash to sustain the business
	- Whether enough cash is generated to pay off existing debts as they mature
	- The firm is likely to need additional financing
	- Unexpected obligations can be met
	- The firm can take advantage of new business opportunities as they arise
- The amount of the total cash flow will be the exact amount of net change in the cash asset in the balance sheet

## Classifications of cash flows
### Introduction to cash flow
**Cash flow statement** provides information beyond that available from the income statement, which provides the following:
- Information about a company's cash receipt and cash payments during an accounting period
- Information about a company's operating investing and financing activities
- An understanding of the impact of accrual accounting events on cash flows

### CF from Operating activities (CFO)
**Operating activities** are the day to day activities, consists of the inflows and the outflows of cash resulting from transactions that affect a firm's net income (Operating cash flow)

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 17.45.40.png]]

### CF from Investing activities (CFI)
**Investing activities** are the inflows and outflows of cash resulting from the acquisition or disposal of long-term assets and certain investment
 ![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 17.45.59.png]]

### CF from Financing activities (CFF)
**Financing activities** consists of the inflows and outflows of cash resulting from transactions affecting a firm's capital structure

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 17.46.19.png]]

## IFRS and US GAAP on CF classification (similarities)
There are several **similarities** between **IFRS** and **US GAAP** in the classification of cash flows for various activities. 

Here are some of the examples:
- **Inventory (purchasing/selling)** - cash flows of sale/purchase of inventory as CFO 
- **Employee salaries** - cash payment to employee classified as CFO
- **Trading Securities (purchasing/selling)** - classified as CFO; **short-term investments actively traded for profit-making purposes** are classified as CFO
- **Long-term asset (acquisition/disposal)** of like PP&E - classified as CFI
- **Investments in equity and debt** - classified as CFI
- **Distribution/repurchase of new shares** - classified as CFF
- **Distribution/repurchase of new debt/bonds** - classified as CFF (**"Notes payable"** refers to a liability or debt owed by a company or individual to a creditor in the form of a promissory note. )

**Note**: It is important to carefully consider all of the items mentioned above has to be cash transaction in order to be in the cash flow statement.

## IFRS and US GAAP on CF classification (differences)
Here are some key differences in cash flow classification between **IFRS** and **US GAAP**.

**Interest and Dividends:**
- **IFRS**: 
	- **Interest and dividends received** can be classified as either CFO or CFI activities.
	- **Interest paid** can be classified as either CFO or CFF activities.
	- **Dividends paid** are classified as CFF activities.
- **US GAAP**: 
	- **Interest paid and interest received** are classified as CFO activities. 
	- **Dividends received** are classified as either CFO or CFI activities. 
	- **Dividends paid** are classified as CFF activities.

**Income Tax**:
- **IFRS**: 
	- **Income taxes paid** can be classified as either CFO or CFF activities.
	- **Income taxes received** can be classified as either CFO or CFI activities.
- **US GAAP**: 
	- **Income taxes paid and income taxes received** are both classified as CFO activities.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 15.14.34.png]]

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 15.15.01.png]]

**Note:** Under IFRS, non-financial companies have the discretion to classify interest received as either CFO or CFI, and interest paid as either CFO or CFF.
Under US GAAP, non-financial companies must classify interest received and paid as CFO.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 15.17.52.png]]

## Non-cash transactions
**Non-cash transactions** is any transaction without the involvement of inflow or outflow of cash, for example:
- non-monetary asset exchange between firms
- stock-dividends to the common shareholder
- conversion of convertible bonds to stock 

The non-cash transactions are not reflected in the cash flow statement, however, **any significant non-cash transaction is required to be disclosed, either in a separate footnote or a supplementary schedule to the cash flow statement**.

## Methods of presenting CFO
There are 2 methods of presentation of cash flows from operations (CFO):
- **Direct method** - presents the cash inflows and outflows directly associated with the company's operating activities
- **Indirect method** - net income from the income statement and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at the net cash flow from operating activities

The main difference between the direct and indirect methods of calculating cash flows is the way that cash flow from operations is calculated. The **direct method starts with sales and follows cash as it flows through the income statement**, while the **indirect method starts with income after taxes and adjusts backwards for non-cash and other items**. Both methods will have the same result for operating cash flows. The direct and indirect method calculates the financing and investing cash flows the same way and both methods will result in the same cash flow figure.

![[Screenshot 2023-07-04 at 19.20.18.png]]

## CFO (Cash flow from operating activities) - Direct
**Direct CFO** converts each line of item of the income statement from the accrual method to cash receipts or cash payments in the cash flow statement

- Under the **accrual method of accounting**, the timing of revenue and expense recognition may differ from the timing of the related cash flows
- Under **cash basis accounting**, revenue and expense recognition occur when cash is received or paid
- analyst always have to approximate the CFO from the balance sheet and income statement

The **direct method of CFO** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{CFO =\sum Cash\,Inflows- \sum Cash\,outflow}$$
where CFO: cash flow from operating activities.

The advantage of direct method of CFO:
- presents firm's operating cash receipts and payments â‡’ more information
- knowledge of past receipts and payments is useful in estimating future CFO

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 17.58.15.png]]


## Preparation of direct Cash Flow Statement from analyst
There are 5 key items that are required for calculating cash flow through **direct** method:
- **Cash from customers** - the cash received from customers, you would start with the company's revenue from the income statement and make adjustments for changes in accounts receivable
- **Cash paid to suppliers** - cash paid to suppliers involves analysing the company's cost of goods sold (COGS) and changes in accounts payable
- **Cash paid for operations** - includes cash expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other operating costs incurred by the company
- **Cash paid for interest** - represents the cash outflows related to interest payments on loans or debt obligations
- **Cash paid for taxes** - refers to the cash outflows associated with income taxes paid by the company to tax authorities

### Cash from customers
- The sales adjusted for changes in receivables and unearned revenue
$$\mathrm{Cash\,from\,customers=Revenue - increase\,in\,account\,receivables}$$
where the revenue and the changes account receivables from one year to another are presented on the balance sheet (e.g. 20x5 to 20x6 in the example below).

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.10.42.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.17.11.png]]

### Cash paid to suppliers
- The goods are either from the **inventory** or from the **suppliers**

Since there is a difference beginning inventory and ending inventory, the remaining from the income statement must be purchased from the suppliers. 

The **cash paid to supplier** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,to\,suppliers=COGS - decrease\,in\,inventory-increase\,in\,AP}$$
where COGS: Cost of goods sold; decrease in inventory between two accounting period; AP: account payable.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.25.10.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.27.58.png]]

However, not all the purchases is made by cash, it could be purchase on credit, so if that's the case, the **cash paid to suppliers** can be calculated through purchases:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,to\,suppliers=Purchases -increase\,in\,AP}$$
where COGS: Cost of goods sold; decrease in inventory between two accounting period; AP: account payable.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.37.30.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.33.49.png]]

> How will a firm's operating cash flow be affected by a decrease in accounts receivable and by an increase in accounts payable? **Both will increase operating cash flow.**
> 
> A decrease in the accounts receivable amount on the balance sheet indicates that cash collections exceed revenues (sales). This increases operating cash flow because receivables are being collected. An increase in the accounts payable amount on the balance sheet indicates that purchases from suppliers exceed cash payments. This increases operating cash flow because the cash was not used to pay the suppliers.

### Cash paid for operation
**Sales, general and admin (SG&A)** adjusted for changes in related accrued liabilities or prepaid expenses. The net cash flow related to the company's operating activities. It is calculated by adjusting net income from the income statement for non-cash expenses (such as depreciation and amortisation) and changes in working capital accounts (such as inventory, prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses).

![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.39.59.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 19.40.24.png]]

$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,for\,operations = SG\&A - Increase\,in\,accrued\,liabilities}$$

### Cash paid for interest
**Cash paid for interest** is the interest expense adjusted for the change in interest payable, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,for\,interest=Interest\,expense -increase\,in\,interest\,payable}$$

### Cash paid for taxes
**Cash taxes paid** is the income tax expense adjusted for changes in taxes payable and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,paid\,for\,taxes = Tax\,expense-Increase\,in\,tax\,payable-Increase\,in\,deferred\,tax\,liabities}$$

## CFO (Cash flow from operating activities) - Indirect
**Indirect CFO (operating cash flow) method**, the net income is converted to operating cash flow by making adjustments for transactions that affect net income but are not cash transactions.

The adjustments include eliminating non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortisation), non-operating items (e.g. gains and losses)

The **indirect method of CFO** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{CFO =Net\,income \pm Adjustments}$$
- It provides a useful link to the income statement when **forecasting** future CFO.
- Forecast net income and adjust by the differences between accrual and cash basis accounting (non-cash items and changes in working capital)
- Companies usually report using indirect method
![[Screenshot 2022-10-27 at 17.58.35.png]]

## Preparation of indirect cash flow statement (CFO)
- The net income is presented in the beginning of the cash flow statement
- Adjust the amount under both the direct and indirect methods of presenting the statement of cash flows
- expensed but no cash outlay
- Investing cash flow should not be included in CFO
- subtract from net income
- Adjust net income for changes in balance sheet accounts
- assets - decrease 
- Liabilities increase

### Steps of preparing the indirect cash flow statement:
1. **Start with net income**: Begin with the net income figure from the income statement.
2. **Add back non-cash expenses**: Since depreciation and amortisation expenses are non-cash items, they are added back to net income.
3. **Adjust for gains and losses**: If the company has reported gains, they are deducted from net income as they are not considered operating cash flows. Conversely, if there are reported losses, they are added back to net income.
4. **Adjust for changes in operating accounts:**
 - **Accounts Receivable (asset)**: If accounts receivable have decreased, it indicates that cash has been collected from customers, so the decrease is added to net income. Conversely, if accounts receivable have increased, it suggests that cash has not been collected, so the increase is deducted from net income.
- **Accounts Payable (liability)**: If accounts payable have increased, it means the company has received goods or services without making immediate cash payments, so the increase is added to net income. Conversely, if accounts payable have decreased, it indicates that cash payments have been made, so the decrease is deducted from net income.
- **Inventories (asset/liability)**: If inventories have decreased, it implies that the company has sold inventory, resulting in cash inflows, so the decrease is added to net income. Conversely, if inventories have increased, it suggests that cash has been used to acquire additional inventory, so the increase is deducted from net income.
- **Other operating assets and liabilities**: Similar adjustments are made for changes in other operating accounts, such as prepaid expenses, accrued expenses, and other working capital items, to reflect the cash impact. **Note**: cash should not be in the equation.

The table below **summarises** the adjustments to be made **based on whether there is an increase or decrease in an asset or liability account**:

|**Type**|**Increase**|**Decrease**|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Asset|-|+|
|Liability|+|-|

> Using indirect method:
> Net Income:   $100,000
> Adj for depreciation:   +$13,000
> Adj for Accounts Receivable (asset):   -$5,000
> Adj for Accounts Payable (liability):   -$7,000
> Adj for Accrued Liabilities:  +$9,000
> Adj for Inventory (Asset):  -$14,000
> CFO = $96,000

## CFI (Cash flow from investing activities)
**Cash flow from investing activities (CFI)** represents the cash flows related to a company's investment activities, it includes cash inflows and outflows associated with:
- Purchase or sale of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)
- Purchase or sale of land
- Acquisition or disposal of intangible assets
- Purchase or sale of investment securities

**Accumulated depreciation or amortisation accounts are ignored since they do not represent cash expenses.**

It can be represented as **net PP&E** on the cash flow statement, and the equations are as follow:
$$\mathrm{Net\,PP\&E=Gross\,PP\&E-Accumulated\,Depreciation}$$
$$\mathrm{Ending\,gross\,PP\&E=Beginning\,gross\,PP\&E+purchased\,new\,PP\&E-Cost\,gross\,of\,PP\&E\,sold}$$
**Gross PP&E** is recorded before any depreciation. We ignore the depreciation expense in this question.

![[Screenshot 2022-10-30 at 14.15.14.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-30 at 14.14.46.png]]
As analyst, more often we're interested in the **purchased new PP&E**, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Purchased\,new\,PP\&E =Increase\,in\,net\,PP\&E+Depreciation\,expense+Cost\,of\,PP\&E\,sold}$$
$$\mathrm{=Ending\,net\,PP\&E-Beginning\,net\,PP\&E+Depreciation\,expense+Cost\,of\,PP\&E\,sold}$$
where if dealing with **gross PP&E**, exclude the depreciation expense

$$\mathrm{Cash\,from\,asset\,sale=Gain\,or\,loss\,on\,sale+Decrease\,in\,asset\,account}$$

## CFF (Cash flow from financing activities)
**CFF** are measurement of the cash flow from the firm to acquire the capital.

There are 2 types of financing activities:
- **Bonds** from creditors
- **Share/Equity** capital from shareholders

### Bonds and CFF
- New borrowing, and principal repayments 
- The interest payments are usually included in the **CFO** under US GAAP
$$\mathrm{Cash\,from\,bond\,issued =Ending\,bonds\,payable-Beginning\,bonds\,payable}$$
**Note:** Under US GAAP, interest expenses should be classified under CFO.

### Share capital and CFF
- New shares issued
- Shares repurchased
- Cash dividend payouts
$$\mathrm{Cash\,to\,repurchase\,stock =Beginning\,share\,capital-Ending\,share\,capital}$$

- Accrual account for dividend declared but not been paid out, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Ending\,dividends\,payable=Beginning\,dividends\,payable+Dividends\,declared-Dividends\,paid}$$
$$\mathrm{Dividends\,paid=Beginning\,dividends\,payable+Dividends\,declared-Ending\,dividends\,payable}$$
where dividends declared are often found in the income statement; this is a financing cash outflow.

**Note**: Financing liabilities are a result of prior financing inflows. Financing liabilities (current) include short-term notes payable and the current maturities of long-term debt.

## Analysis of cash flow statements
**Cash flow statement** s a â€˜summarised bank statementâ€™ that shows an organisationâ€™s sources of cash during the financial year and the ways in which the cash has been used during that period (e.g. investments, fixed asset purchases, etc.).

**Cash flow statements**:
- can provide useful information for understanding the company's business and earnings
- useful for predicting future cash flows
- analysis of sources of cash, uses of cash, ratios, and common-size analysis

### Sources and uses of cash
The major 3 cash flows of the company are mentioned above:
- **Cash flow from operation (CFO)**
- **Cash flow from investment activities (CFI)**
- **Cash flow from financing activities (CFF)**

#### Early stage growth company
If the company is in its early state growth:
- they may experience a negative CFO, possibly due to purchasing inventory and development costs (i.e. - CFO)
- they may experience negative CFI, acquire long-term asset (i.e. - CFI)
- they might also have a positive CFF, due to the issuance of debt and equity (i.e. + CFF)

However, this model is not sustainable, eventually the company must transform to a sustainable growth company.
![[Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 12.07.32.png]]
**Note:** Companies which are growing tend to invest in capital assets to grow the business. High CFI may not be an indication of growth. Â A company may be selling assets and/or reducing capital expenditures, resulting in high CFI. Low CFI may be a result of poor investment decisions.

### Sustainable growth company
- A **sustainable growth company** must generate cash from CFO, and return the cash to the debt and equity owners through CFF.
- Allocate capital efficiently through CFI

![[Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 12.08.07.png]]

### Analysis of CFO
- The sources of CFO can be from:
	- Earnings-related activities
	- Liquidating inventory and receivables â‡’ â†‘ Cash flow â‡’ â†‘ CFO (not sustainable)
- The uses for CFO:
	- Increasing payables â‡’ â†“ Cash outflow â‡’ â†‘ CFO (not sustainable)
- A stable relationship with earnings to CFO is a sign of quality earnings
- Earnings >> CFO, might just be an aggressive choice of accounting
- If the CFO is negative, the company is either operating on:
	- Investment activities
	- Financing activities
	- Previous cash balances
	- Owner funding the business
	- However, in the long term, a business must generate cash from operating, as that is what sustains the business

### Analysis of CFI
The sources of CFI can be from:
- Sell capital assets
	- Short-term â‡’ â†‘ cash inflow â‡’ â†‘ CFI
	- Long-term â‡’ â†“ cash inflow â‡’ â†“ CFI

The uses for CFI:
- Increasing CAPEX â‡’ Indication of growth
- Reducing CAPEX 
	- Short-term â‡’ â†“ cash outflow â‡’ â†‘ CFI
	- Long-term â‡’ â†‘ cash outflow â‡’ â†“ CFI

### Analysis of CFF
The sources of CFF can be from:
- Issue debt
- Issue equity

The uses for CFF:
- Repay debt
- Reacquire stock
- Pay dividends
- e.g. Is the firm issuing debt to reacquire stock or pay dividends? It is a red flag since cash to shareholders should ideally come from CFO.

### Free cash flow (FCF)
**Free cash flow (FCF)** provides the overview of sustainability for the company, if the company has consistent free cash flow, it is considered to be a sustainable firm.

Operating cash flow (CFO) falls short as it doesn't take into account expenses into account expenses on long-term assets

The **multi-step equation for FCF** is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Net\,CFO = CFO\,inflow-CFP\,outflow}$$
$$\mathrm{FCF = Net\,CFO-FC_Inv}$$
where $FC_{Inv}$: **fixed capital investment (also known as CapEx, capital expenditure)**.  It is desirable for a firm's CFO to cover $FC_{Inv}$, to have positive FCF.

A high FCF can be used to:
- Pay off debt
- reinvest into business
- as a dividend for the owners
Therefore, with FCF really gives a flexibility and consistently, as high FCF is the holy grail of running a company.

For an analyst, for valuation of the company and its securities, these two metrics might be useful: 
- **Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)**
- **Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)**

![[Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 13.10.28.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 13.10.44.png]]

### Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)
**Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** represents the cash flow available to all providers of capital, including both equity and debt holders. It measures the cash generated by a company's operations that is available to be distributed to all stakeholders.

The equation of **free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{FCFF = CFO-FC_Inv}$$
where FCFF is the free cash flow to the firm; CFO: cash flow for operating activities; $FC_{Inv}$: fixed capital investment or known as CapEx.

Under US GAAP or some IFRS, the interest is under the CFO outflow. The interest should also be included under FCFF because it is the interest available to the creditors
Since it is before tax, the equation requires the interest to multiply (1-Tax), **free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{FCFF = CFO-FC_Inv+Interest\times(1-T)}$$
where T: tax, $FC_{Inv}$: fixed capital investment or known as CapEx, interest: interest for debt obligation.

and the equation of **free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is as follows:
$$\mathrm{CFO = NI+NCC-WC_Inv}$$
where NI: net income; NCC: non-cash charges; $WC_{Inv}$: Working capital investment

### Free cash flow to the equity (FCFE)
**Free cash flow to the equity (FCFE)** cash flow available to the company's equity shareholders after all expenses, debt obligations, and reinvestments have been accounted for. It measures the cash that can be distributed to the shareholders of the company.

As interest is only paid to creditors, FCFE does not include interest in the equation.
However, the net borrowing should be included in the calculation.
$$\mathrm{CFF\,from\,debt\,issued = Net\,borrowing+Debt\,redeemed}$$

Therefore, the **free cash flow to the equity (FCFE)** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{FCFE = CFO-FC_Inv+Net\,borrowing}$$
If there is extra FCFE, it is available for distribution to the shareholders, but again, it is not compulsory for a firm to give out dividends.

### Ratios calculated from CFO
**Ratios calculated from CFO** can be categorised into:
- **performance ratios** - measures profitability
- **coverage ratios** - measures solvency

### Performance ratio
**Performance ratio** measures profitability of the firm.

There are 5 types of performance ratios:
- **Cash flow to revenue** - Amount of operating cash flow generated for each dollar of sales
- **Cash return on assets** - Return of operating cash flow attributed to all providers of capital
- **Cash return on equity** - Return of operating cash flow attributed to shareholders
- **Cash to income** - Ability to generate cash from firm operations
- **Cash flow per share -** Operating cash flow on a per-share basis (alternative to EPS)

**Cash flow to revenue** is the amount of operating cash flow generated for each dollar of sales, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,flow\,to\,revenue = \frac{CFO}{Net\,revenue}}$$

**Cash return on assets** is the return of operating cash flow attributed to all providers of capital, and the equation is as follows: 
$$\mathrm{Cash\,return\,on\,assets = \frac{CFO}{Avg\,total\,assets}}$$


**Cash flow on equity** is the the return of operating cash flow attributed to shareholders, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,flow\,on\,equity = \frac{CFO}{Avg\,shareholder's\,equity}}$$

**Cash flow to income** is the ability to generate cash from firm operations, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,to\,income = \frac{CFO}{Operating\,income}}$$

**Cash flow per share** is the operating cash flow on a per-share basis (alternative to EPS), and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Cash\,flow\,per\,share = \frac{CFO-preferred\,div}{No.\,of\,common\,shares\,outstanding}}$$

### Coverage ratio
The **coverage ratio** measures solvency and the long-term viability of the firm.

There are 6 types of coverage ratios:
- **Debt coverage** - measures the financial risk and leverage
- **Interest coverage** - measures the firm's ability to meet its interest obligations
- **Reinvestment**  - measures the firm's ability to acquire long-term assets with operating cash flow
- **Debt payment** - measures firm's ability to satisfy long-term debt with operating cash flow
- **Dividend payment** - measures the firm's ability to make dividends payments from operating cash flow
- **Investing and financing** - measures the firm's ability to purchase assets, satisfy debts and pay dividends

**Debt coverage** measures the company's ability to service its outstanding debt obligations by using operating cash flow, it measures the financial risk and leverage, and the **debt coverage** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,coverage = \frac{CFO}{Total\,debt}}$$

**Interest coverage** assesses a company's ability to meet its interest expenses, and the **interest coverage** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Interest\,coverage = \frac{CFO+Interest\,paid+Taxes\,paid}{Interest\,paid}}$$
**Note:** If interest paid was classified as a financing activity under IFRS, no interest adjustment is necessary.

**Reinvestment** evaluates a company's ability to finance its long-term assets using its operating cash flow, and the **reinvestment** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Reinvestment = \frac{CFO}{Cash\,paid\,for\,long\,term \,assets}}$$

**Debt payment** measures a company's ability to repay its long-term debt obligations using its operating cash flow, and the **debt payment** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Debt\,payment = \frac{CFO}{Cash\,paid\,for\,long\,term \,repayment}}$$

**Dividend payment** assess company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders from its operating cash flow, and the **dividend payment** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Dividend\,payment = \frac{CFO}{Dividend\,paid}}$$

**Investing and financing ratio** evaluates a company's ability to fund its investing activities (such as purchasing assets), debt repayments, and dividend payments using its operating cash flow, and the **investing and financing** equation is as follow:
$$\mathrm{Investing\,\&\,financing = \frac{CFO}{Cash\,outflow\,for\,investing\,and\,financing}}$$


### The overview of all ratio metrics to measure company's profitability and solvency:

## Common size analysis for cash flow statement
**Common size analysis for cash flow statement**:
- can either be presented as 
	- the **percentage of net revenue**
	- **each cash flow outflow as a percentage of all cash outflows**
	- **each cash inflow as a percentage of all cash inflows**
- is useful to compare between different periods or different firms
- should inspect the balance sheet and income statement for clues
