## Portfolio planning
The are three main stages of the portfolio management process:
- the planning stage
- the execution or construction stage
- the feedback or maintenance stage

As a portfolio manager/advisor, have to ensure the compatibility and realistic expectations from after analysing the client's risk tolerance and return objectives.

### The planning stage
The planning stage begins with an analysis of your client's:
- Risk tolerance
- Return objectives
- Time horizon
- Tax exposure
- Liquidity needs,
- Legal and regulatory constraints
- Unique circumstances or preferences.
**Remember the acronym of ("RRTTLLU").**

### Risk tolerance
**Risk tolerance** refers to the a function of:
- **the client's ability to bear risk** - based on financial situation (e.g. investment horizon, level of wealth, job security, insurance)
- **the client's willingness to bear risk** - based on attitudes and beliefs about investments, often assessed through short questionnaires or interviews but can be quite subjective

The ability to bear risk depends on his financial circumstances, his investment horizon, level of wealth relative to liabilities, job security and how well insured he is are all factors that determine his ability to bear risk.

e.g. if his investment horizon is 20 years, his portfolio has the time to ride out potential market volatility. If he's wealthy and has job security, he's able to absorb big losses without compromising much of his lifestyle. High insurance payouts provide a cushion in times of financial hardship.

#### Risk allocation after assessing risk tolerance
If the client's ability and willingness to take investment risk are compatible, there's no real problem selecting an appropriate level of investment risk.

However, if the willingness is high but the ability to take risk is low, the low ability to take risk should have precedence, which means that the client's risk tolerance is low.

You should not allow the client to take high risks as his circumstances don't allow for that and explain your rationale to the client.

When the ability is high, but willingness is low, you may want to attempt to educate your client about investment risk. If your client changes his mind after having his misconceptions cleared, his risk tolerance can be marked as high. Otherwise, his risk tolerance should be marked as low.

**General rule**: conform to the **lower** of your clients ability or willingness to bear risk.

Constructing a portfolio with a level of risk that your client is uncomfortable with can lead to misunderstandings if the portfolio performs poorly in the short term.

### Return objectives
The return objectives can be stated in a number of ways:
- **Absolute return objective** - either strict limits, probability, nominal, real
- **Relative return objective** - relative to a benchmark

#### Absolute return objective
An **absolute return objective** might stated in terms of strict limits or probability, nominal value, or real value:
- **Strict limits** -  e.g. "no decrease in value by more than 3% at any point over any 12 month period." Such short term objectives with strict limits may result in portfolios made up of very low risk securities that offer guaranteed returns.
- **Probability** - e.g. "no greater than a 5% probability of returns below -3% in any 12 month period"
- **Nominal** - e.g. "overall return of at least 7% per year"
- **Real** - e.g. "return of 4% more than the inflation rate each year"

#### Relative return objective
**Relative return objective** can also be set as strict limits or probability agains a certain **benchmark**. The **benchmark** chosen is often according to the type of client.

The most common benchmark:
- **Equity index** - e.g. S&P500
- **Interest rate** - for companies with floating rate liabilities e.g. 180-day LIBOR
- **Cost of funds** - for bank - interest rate that it pays for deposits
- **Peer performance** - for institutions (e.g. endowment) - "top quartile of endowment fund returns"; however it is not investible, so no way of replicating the benchmark return before the fact

### Time horizon
The **time horizon** is the amount of time until the investor needs to withdraw. In general, the longer the time horizon, the more risk the investor can afford to take in the portfolio.
An investor with a 20 year investment horizon to grow his retirement fund can afford to place a large portion of the investment in risky equities as he has the time to ride through the market volatility.

In contrast, an investor with just a year to go before needing the cash for a home purchase should place most of the portfolio in low risk assets like short term bonds and government securities. The short term investor cannot afford to risk losing too much when the redemption is so near.

### Tax exposure
**Tax implications** is also another important area to analyse investors subject to higher marginal tax rates may **prefer tax-free bonds** to taxable bonds or **prefer equities that are expected to produce capital gains** vs dividend stocks. In many jurisdictions, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than dividends received.

In contrast, tax exempt investors like pension funds often pay little or no tax, so the choice of securities often do not take into account the tax implications.

### Liquidity needs
**Liquidity** refers to the ability to turn investment assets into cash in a short period of time without having to make significant price concessions to do so. Different types of investors have different levels of liquidity needs. The assessment of the clients liquidity needs will highly influence the type of securities deemed suitable for the client's portfolio.

e.g. banks and insurance companies have high liquidity needs to meet unexpected increases in withdrawals or insurance claims. Therefore, highly illiquid investments like hedge funds and private equity may be unsuitable for the portfolios of banks and insurance companies.

e.g 2.defined benefit pension plans and endowment funds tend to have low liquidity needs as the amount of unanticipated needs for cash is low.

### Legal constraints 
**Legal constraints** are the applicable laws and regulations that investors are required to comply with.

Some of which are:
- General financial regulations - applies to all market participants
- Specific legal and regulatory constraints - for some particular types of investors
	- restriction from investing in **particular types** of securities and assets
	- restrictions on **percentage allocations** to specific types of investments
	- corporate officers and directors are also often barred from insider trading, that is to trade in the securities of their firms or related firms

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 16.20.31.png]]

### Unique circumstances
There are some **unique circumstances** in some clients may have **specific preferences or restrictions** on which securities and assets may be purchased for the portfolio. These are not legally required, but **solely based on the client's values and preferences**.

Some of the notable unique circumstances:
- **Ethical preferences** - prohibit investment in tobacco companies, weapons producers, casinos and companies with a record of human rights abuses.
- **Religious preferences** - preclude investments that are inconsistent with the investors faith in particular, i.e. bonds since the islamic law prohibits lending on interest
- **Diversification needs** - avoid concentration risk by excluding the industry that the client works in (e.g. the client works in the oil and gas industry, he may want to exclude oil and gas securities in his portfolio; a business owner may not want any investment in securities issued by a competitor to his company)

### Investment policy statement (IPS)
After all these items have been gathered and analysed, portfolio manager should document your findings in an **investment policy statement (IPS)**. 

The **Investment policy statement (IPS) major components** include:
- a description of the client; a statement of purpose
- a statement of duties and responsibilities
- procedures to update the IPS;
- investment objectives
- investment constraints
- investment guidelines
- and benchmark for evaluation of performance.

The key element of the IPS is the **investment objectives and constraints** which act as guiding principles for you and any other parties managing the portfolio.

The **IPS** should also **specify a benchmark** that can be used in the **feedback stage** to **assess the performance of the portfolio** and whether **objectives** have been met and **should be updated every few years** or **when investor's objective/constraints changes.** 

## Portfolio construction
Once the client has approved the IPS, you as the portfolio manager can proceed to the next stage, which is **portfolio construction** based on the IPS.

### Stages of portfolio construction
Portfolio construction steps are done by:
1. Setting the investor's **capital market expectations**
2. Deciding on a **strategic asset allocation**
3. Varying the strategy through **tactical asset allocation**
4. Followed by **security selection**

### Analogy of football team
You can use the analogy of a football team to help you understand the process.

Imagine you're a football coach and your client is the football club owner who hired you to coach the team. Your task is to win the game for the football club owner.

1. Forming **capital market expectations** is analogous to the preparation and study of the competition.
2. **Strategic asset allocation** is analogous to forming a game strategy to win.
3. **Tactical asset allocation** are deviations from the strategy based on circumstances as the game proceeds. For example, if the team is behind, the coach may move one midfielder up to be a forward as a tactical move
4. **Security selection** is the selection of specific players to fill in each role.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.21.52.png]]

With that, let's discuss each of these steps in detail.

### Capital market expectations
**Capital market expectations** are the investors expectations concerning the risk and return prospects of asset classes. 

Asset classes include: 
- **Equities** - domestic vs. foreign, large vs. small, developed vs. emerging markets
- **Bonds** - domestic vs. foreign, developed vs. emerging markets, investment grade vs high-yield
- **Alternative investment** - hedge funds, private equity funds, commodities and real estate

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.25.23.png]]

As the portfolio manager will collect data on:
- **long term expected returns**
- **standard deviation of returns**
- **correlations of returns** with those of other asset classes.

The correlation of returns is stated in the form of a correlation matrix where each cell represents the correlation of one asset to the other.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.26.00.png]]

### Strategic asset allocation
An efficient frontier can be constructed using a computer program based on:
- the expected returns
- standard deviation returns
- the correlation of returns of the various asset classes

With this, you can determine the capital allocation line and the **optimal risky portfolio** for your client. By combining the **risk/return objectives from the IPS**, you can identify that portfolio **which best meets the risk and return requirements** of your client. The asset allocation for this optimal portfolio is the **strategic asset allocation** for your client's portfolio.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.26.12.png]]

#### Passive management
**Passive management** construct and maintain the proportions as per the **strategic asset allocation**. 

e.g. For simplicity of illustration, we narrow down the strategic asset allocation to:
- **US large cap stocks** - e.g. replicate the returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
- **Investment grade bonds** - e.g. investment grade bond index
- **US Treasury bonds** as the risk-free asset

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.41.46.png]]

#### Active management
**Active management** deviates from the **strategic asset allocation** of perceived short-term opportunity.

#### Tactical asset allocation
e.g. **Tactical asset allocation** is when if your analysis shows that stocks are overvalued relative to bonds, you may deviate from the strategic asset allocation by understating stocks and overweighting bonds in the short term

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.41.36.png]]

### Security selection
You can take the active management further by deviating from the index weights within each asset class. Security selection is when


e.g. if the weight of Apple shares in the Dow Jones is currently 5% and your analysis shows that Apple stock is undervalued, you may choose to overweight on Apple

### Risk budgeting
While each of these active strategies may produce higher returns, they each also increase the risk of the active portfolio compared to a passive portfolio of asset class indices. A practice known as risk budgeting sets an overall risk limit for the portfolio and associates a portion of the permitted risk to the systematic risk of the **strategic asset allocation**.

![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 17.45.11.png]]

### Issues with active management
Active portfolio management has two specific issues to consider:
- your client may have multiple active managers that benchmark against the same index for the same asset class (utilised active risk budget but net effect on client's returns eliminated; offsetting positions cancels out active returns)
- trading may be excessive and unnecessary (higher capital gains taxes, and trading expenses)

### Core-satellite approach
The **core-satellite approach** reduces the likelihood of offsetting active positions and unnecessary trading as it's less likely to have overlapping securities between the core and
satellite portfolios.

The  **core-satellite approach**:
- The client places the majority of his funds in **core portfolios that are passively managed tracking market indices**.
- The rest of the funds are placed in **actively managed satellite portfolios that do not track market indices but are aggressively managed to produce higher returns**

### ESG approach
**ESG integration i**s the integration of environmental, social and governance factors throughout the portfolio management process.

There are several ways in integration of ESG into portfolio:
- **Negative screening** - exclusion of companies or industries that have poor ESG track records
- **Positive screening** - selection of companies that have positive ESG practices.
- **Thematic investing** - sectors or companies based on a specific ESG-related theme.
- **Impact investing** - seeks to achieve targeted social or environmental objectives along with measurable financial returns.
- **Engagement or active ownership** - a strategy to use share ownership as a platform to promote better ESG practices at a company.

One issue for portfolio managers is that of benchmarking the use of traditional broad market indices as the benchmark may not be appropriate as the investment universe in ESG investing is limited.

In recent years, benchmarks that exclude certain companies or sectors have been made available, but it may still be difficult to find appropriate benchmarks for the wide variety of ESG investing approaches.

#### Shareholder engagement
Shareholder engagement is another key aspect of ESG investing.

This involves investors communicating with companies about their practices and trying to influence positive change.

This can be done through:
- individual engagement, where an influential investor communicate directly with the company
- collaborative engagement initiatives such as the Climate Action 100+, where investors work together to engage with companies on issues of concern.

For investment managers with clients who wish to engage in active ownership, it is important to clarify whether the clients intend to vote their shares themselves or direct the managers to vote the shares according to specified ESG factors.

#### Goal of ESG investment
Ultimately, the goal of ESG investing is to create a positive impact on society and the environment while still generating financial returns.

Many stock exchanges and regulatory bodies around the world have set up guidelines for corporate sustainability disclosures for listed companies, and there are also frameworks and standards such as the **Principles of Responsible Investment** and the **UN Global Compact** that can help form the basis of responsible investing policies for investors.

Regardless of the approach, investors should be aware that the effort and costs associated with limiting the investment universe **may suggest a negative impact** on investment returns.

However, **some may argue that the potential improvements in governance and the avoidance of ESG related risks can improve portfolio returns in the long term**. The ESG integration approach is now widely adopted across mainstream funds due to investor demands.

Investors with a time horizon constraint may have little time for capital appreciation before they need the money. Need for money in the near term is a liquidity constraint. Time horizon and liquidity constraints often go hand in hand. Diversification often requires the sale of an investment and the purchase of another. Investment sales often trigger tax liability. Younger investors should take advantage of tax deferrals while they have time for the savings to compound, and while they are in their peak earning years. Many retirees have little income and face less tax liability on investment returns.
