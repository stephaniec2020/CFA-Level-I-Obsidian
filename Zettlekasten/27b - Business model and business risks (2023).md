## Business model
**Business model** can give a value proposition of the company (i.e. valuation of a company), an analyst can understand the business and find out the drivers and the strategy of the business to earn money from customers/consumers. It is not equivalent to the business plan (which includes the revenue/expense projection and financial plans).
There are 3 aspects of the business model can be used to analyse the business: **value chain**, **value proposition** and **profitability**

### Value proposition
It is the attributes of a product or service that can win the consumer to pick the product/service against other competitors. 
There are 4 major **value propositions**:
- **Target customer (Who)** - Geography, market segment (e.g. middle income, early adopters), customer segment (B2B/B2C) â‡’ gives us information on how to acquire, cost of acquisition, monitor and maintain customer satisfaction
- **Product offering (What)** - how they meet the customer's need, how the services differentiate from competitors (lower prices, premium quality, innovation)
- **Channel strategy (Where)**
	- Traditional (manufacturer â†’ wholesaler â†’ retailer â†’ target customers)
	- Some can be direct sales from manufacturer (e.g. complex/high margin products/services (e.g. industrial equipment, life insurance)), B2B market, e-Commerce, drop-shipping (online marketers arranges goods delivery direct from manufacturer to end customer)
	- Omnichannel - purchase online and collect in store
- **Pricing strategy (How much)**

#### Pricing strategy
- **Value-based pricing** - based on the value or perceived value received by the customer
- **Cost-base pricing** - based on **production cost** + profit
- **Price discrimination** - setting different prices for different groups of customers based on their **willingness to pay**
- **Tiered pricing** - based on **purchase volume** (e.g. get 20% off when you buy 3 units)
- **Dynamic pricing** - different prices at different times (e.g. off-peak pricing, surge pricing, congestion pricing)
- **Auction pricing** - establishes prices through bidding (e.g. eBay)
- **Bundle pricing for complementary products** (e.g. hotel and breakfast, mobile and home broadband, software suite) - Bundling is a pricing strategy for multiple products. Firms that rent or lease major assets (an asset-light model) or receive cash before providing goods or services (a pay-in-advance model) tend to have less need for capital than firms that own fixed assets or do not collect cash in advance.
- **Razors-and-blade pricing** - sell equipment cheaply, but consumables at high margin (e.g. printer & cartridges, game console & game titles)
- **Optional product pricing** - allows customer to buy additional services or features at point of purchase or afterward 
- **Penetration pricing** - offer product at a low margin, even at a loss (for digital services that require critical mass e.g. Disney+), also **free trial** and **freemium** are considered as penetration pricing; **freemium** allow for basic functionality free, but require payment for additional features
- **Hidden revenue** - provide services for free but generate revenue elsewhere (e.g. search engine - company earns by selling ads)
- **Subscription model** - customer "rent" product while they need it (e.g. MS Office 365)
- **Fractional ownership** - use of products is broken up and sold in parts (e.g. web server capacity, co-working spaces)
- **Licensing** - allow to use a certain intangible asset (e.g. brand name, IP), licensing fee can be fixed or variable (% revenue generated)

- Beside value proposition, there are others to consider:
	- **Product capability, performance or style**
	- **Pricing relative to competition**
	- **Sales process**
	- **Service provided and after-sales support**

### Value chain
**Value chain** is how the value proposition is **delivered**. It depends on the firm's **assets** and **capability** to deliver this value, which is critical to deliver to the success of the business model.
Understand how the company gains its assets (outsourcing?, assets include patent and employees) and how to leverage on their assets and capabilities to deliver the value.

Value chain $\ne$ supply chain, which is every step in producing and delivering the product

**Value chain analysis** by linking the **value proposition**, **value chain** and **profitability** includes:
- What are the activities that add value?
- What is the value added and cost associated with each activity?
- Are there any opportunities for competitive advantage?

**According to Michael Porter**, there are 5 primary activities of a company:
- Inbound logistics
- Outbound logistics
- Operations
- Marketing 
- Sales and services

4 primary support activities:
- Procurement
- Human resources
- Tech development
- Firm infrastructure

### Profitability
- Profit margin (covered in financial statement analysis)
- Break-even point (covered under Economics)
- Unit economics (covered under Economics)

## Types of business model
There are the different types of business models:
- Traditional (goods-producing sectors) - Supply chain (e.g. raw material supplier, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer)
- Diverse service sectors (e.g. financial services - insurance, brokerage, trading, investment banking, asset management etc.)
- Innovative new business (location is less important as purchases can be made online, easier to reach potential customers - digital marketing, easier to outsource - efficient resources allocation)
	- Network effect (â†‘ users and â†‘ value, penetration pricing model to grow network of uses)
	- Crowdsourcing - knowledge aggregator, open-source software, crowdfunding
	- E-commerce - affiliate marketing, marketplace (e.g eBay), aggregator, marketed under own brand (white-labelling, e.g spotify, uber)
	- Hybrid model - traditional + digital

## Business model and risks (risk and leverage implications)
### Macro, business and financial risk
There are 3 key risks to business models, which categorises into the **macro**, **business**, and **financial** risks.
**Macro** risks are the external factors that affects all businesses in the economy.
**Business** risks can arise from industry factors and firm-specific factors.
**Financial** risks can be stem from the increase of debt due to firm-specific factors, which â†‘ financial leverage and leads to higher risks.
All are interrelated where the top-down macro risks can trigger business risks, which in turn increases the financial risks of the firm.

### Macroeconomic factors and risks
#### Economic conditions
- GDP growth, inflation, interest rate, unemployment rate
- Non-cyclical or defensive firms are less affected than cyclical firms
#### Demographic trends
- aging population in mature economies, growing labour shortages
#### Social and political trends
- Change in consumer tastes
- e.g. green and sustainable products, healthy living, remote work
#### Legal/regulatory environment
- stable and consistent laws
- contracts easily enforceable
- necessary to protect consumers, ensure fair competition

### Business risks - industry factors
There are certain industry factors - which affect overall level of demand, pricing and profitability, in turn affects the operating income, which ties to the financial risks.
#### Earnings cyclicality
- discretionary goods, long lived goods *(e.g. cars, appliance, housing, capital equipment)* are **cyclical** as buyers can choose when to replace them
- inputs to such industries may also face cyclical demand
#### Industry structure (concentration) 
- low concentration (market share divided among many small firms) â‡’ high competitive intensity = lower profitability = more affected by the macro risks
#### Competitive dynamics within the value chain
Porter's 5 forces:
- Current competitors
- New entrants
- Substitutes
- Buyers
- Suppliers
#### Growth and demand outlook
- Weaker players can run into financial difficulty if outlook is poor

### Business risks - Firm-specific factors
#### Competitive risk
- Losing market share or pricing power due to lack of competitive advantage
- Level of competitive pressure and risk increase
#### Product market risk
- Risk that the demand for a product or service will be lower than a firm's expectation (due to change in preference, product obsolescence)
- Firms with many products will face less risk
- Startup/firms with few products will face more risk
#### Capital investment risk
- Potential for sub-optimal investments by the firm (i.e. ROI < Cost of capital)
- Concern for mature businesses that seek to acquire smaller firms
#### ESG risk
- risk of running afoul environmental, social and corporate governance expectations can damage a company's reputation and bottom line

### Leverage amplifies risk
#### Higher operating leverage means higher business risks
The operating leverage is understood by the costs of the company (fixed cost and variable costs), with higher fixed cost, there is a higher business risk.

- The fixed cost play a role in the EBIT variability thus operating leverage
	Examine two firms with different amount of fixed cost and variable cost. From the income statement, $\mathrm{Revenue - Cost = EBIT (operating\,income)}$. When the firm is growing in sales, the one with lower variable fixed cost is going to have a â†‘ EBIT since it has lower variable cost; however the one with lower fixed cost will have higher variable cost.
![[Screenshot 2023-01-13 at 18.08.15.png | 300]] ![[Screenshot 2023-01-13 at 18.10.54.png | 200]]
Therefore, the fixed cost play a role in the EBIT variability.

The equation of calculating operating leverage is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Operating\,leverage = \frac{Revenue}{EBIT}}$$
- Another fixed cost for businesses are "interest cost" to pay to the creditors, the greater the debt that a company has will affect the interest cost. However, one can argue that it brings the firm with higher financial leverage, which in turn again increases the firm's financial risks.

The equation of calculating operating leverage is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Finacial\,leverage = \frac{EBIT}{EBT}}$$

The total leverage of a firm is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Total\,leverage = Financial\,leverage \times Operating\,leverage}$$
therefore, companies with high fixed cost and high debt will have high business risks.

### Implications on business model
**Capital intensive business** - have high business risks due to the high fixed cost (employees' salary) and fixed capital investments

Therefore, there are some alternative business model to reduce leverage risks:
- Asset light 
- Lean startups
- Pay-in-advance

#### Asset light
- Ownerships of high-cost assets ***shifted*** to other firms 
	- e.g. **Franchise** model (hotel chain lends its brand name and management expertise to franchisees. Franchisees own the hotel building and hire their own staff to operate the hotel)
#### Lean startups
- asset light, and outsource many functions
	- Younger tech companies tend to adopt this approach, which allow them to scale up or down quickly without needing that much capital
#### Pay-in-advance
- reduce or eliminate the need for working capital
	- Collect cash from sales before paying suppliers, so there is minimal or even negative working capital. Working capital can be a source of cash

### Conflict of interest for lenders and shareholders
#### How much should a business leverage?
A business has to take care of both the interest of lenders and shareholders:
Lender would prefer lower leverages as it provides less uncertainty, however, the shareholders would prefer higher leverage as it provides with higher potential investment gains.
