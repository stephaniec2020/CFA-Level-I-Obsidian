## Use of industry analysis and approaches to classification

### Motivations
The motivation in studying a company within the industry are as follows:
- Understand a company's business environment
- Identify investment opportunities
- Portfolio performance attribution

#### Understand a company's business environment
**Understand a company's business environment** let the analyst to understand the business environment of the company and understand the potential growth, competition and risks. 
	- e.g. For a credit analyst, the industry conditions can provide insight on whether the firm can service its debt.

#### Identify investment opportunities
From **a top-down approach**, industry approach can provide some insights and identify which industries that are undervalued or overvalued. 

Some investors involve in **industry rotation**, which are weightings industries base on the current phase of the business cycle. 
- e.g. In a recessionary market, investors turn to more safe haven *(i.e. consumer staples - such as food and beverages, healthcare)* and underweight on risky sectors (*e.g. technology*)

#### Portfolio performance attribution
Sources of the industry attribution is often compared to a benchmark, the proportion of the major company in the industry is often significant in the attribution analysis.

## Approaches to industry classification
There are 3 approaches to classify companies into different attributes:
- Product and/or service offered
- Business cycle sensitivities
- Statistical similarities

### Products and/or services offered
- Industry classification systems - **Sector** refers to a group of related industries (principal business activities)
	 - e.g. Energy sector, finance sector, healthcare sector includes biotechnology industry, hospital industry, medical device industry, pharmaceutical industry
	 - The industry classification system have global industry classification standard (GICS), Russell global sectors, Industry classification benchmark
	 - Some firms offers produces/services across different industries, it will then be classified based on primary business activity (the income/revenue driver).

### Business cycle sensitivities
Firms can also be classified according to the sensitivity to the business cycle (expansion/contraction):
- Cyclical 
- Non-cyclical
However, the descriptors should be used with caution as the business cycle sensitivity is a spectrum. The categorisation can be somewhat arbitrary, as the "non-cyclical" ones can be affected by severe recessions and "defensive" may not always be a safe haven.

**Cyclical** firms are:
- where **profits** are **strongly correlated** with the overall economy, i.e. high demand during expansion phase, and low demand during contraction phase
- the **products** are **expensive and discretionary** - ¬†consumers typically decrease their purchases of these items during economic recessions
- the industry includes:
	- autos, housings, basic materials, industrials
- the sector includes:
	- energy, financials, technology, consumer discretionary
-  it can also include "growth firms" that are less dependent on the business cycle, has demand that is strong enough that earnings remain relatively unaffected by the business cycle.

**Non-cyclical** firms are:
- where their **profits** are largely independent of the business cycle
- **product** demand stable throughout the business cycle
- the industry includes:
	- food and beverages, household and personal care products
- the sector includes:
	- healthcare, utilities, consumer staples
- it can be further subdivided into "**growth**" and "**defensive**":
	- **growth** - demand so strong that they are **largely unaffected** by the stage of the business cycle, typically characterised by above-normal expansion in sales and profits independent of the business cycle.
	- defensive - **least affected** by the stage of the business cycle, **products are necessary** even in economic downturn
		- e.g. consumer staples, basic services

### Statistical similarities 
Companies can also be grouped by the correlations of past returns of their shares, which is known as **cluster analysis**. There are high correlation of past returns with the same group of stocks and low correlation of returns with another group of stocks.

However, there are some limitations with this method:
- The group can constitute of non-intuitive group of companies
- The composition of the groups may vary significantly by time period and across countries
- Historical correlations may not continue in the future
- It is susceptible to statistical error, falsely including and excluding a company in there by chance


## Industry classification systems
Well-designed classification system allow analyst to extract meaningful industry trends, compare valuations amongst the group, and different countries on a similar basis.  

### Commercial classification
There are 3 commonly used commercial standards across US and UK:
- Global industry classification standard by S&P and MSCI Barra
- Russell Global sectors by Russell Investments
- Industry Classification benchmark by Dow Jones and FTSE

![[Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 19.11.28.png]]

There are 10 top tier 1 categories that are common to all industry classification system:
- **Basic materials and processing** - companies that produces building materials, chemicals, paper and forest products, containers and packaging, metal and mineral, and mining companies
- **Consumer discretionary** - companies that sell goods or services that are highly sensitive to business cycle - automotive, apparel, hotel and restaurant business
- **Consumer staples** - companies that sell goods that are less sensitive to business cycle e.g. manufacturers of food, beverages, tobacco, and personal care products.
- **Energy** - companies that are involved in energy exploration, production, or refining of natural resources, selling equipment or providing services to energy companies.
- **Financial services** - companies that are involved in banking, finance, insurance, real estate, asset management, and/or brokerage services
- **Healthcare** - manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, biotech products, medical devices, healthcare equipment, and medical supplies; providers of healthcare services
- **Industrial/producer durables** - manufacturers of capital goods and providers of commercial services, like heavy machinery and equipment, aerospace, defence, transportation services, and commercial services and supplies
- **Technology** - companies that sell or produce computers, softwares, semi-conductors, and communication equipment, providers of electronic entertainment, internet services, and technology consulting services
- **Utilities** - companies that are involved in generation and distribution of electric, gas and water
- **Telecommunications** - providers of fixed-line and wireless communication services

### Government classification
The common goal is to facilitate the comparison of data, over time and among countries.
The **International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC)** address the need for international comparability of economic statistics. The classification system is used by the **IMF**, **world bank**, and **most countries** have followed this system.

With the exception of these:
The **European version** is called the **Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community**.
The **Australian and New Zealand** have their own, which is called **Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification**.
The **US and Canada** have jointly developed one as well, which is called **North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)**. Where there are 5 levels of categories with 4 levels that are comparable and the last category provides for more country-specific detail.

#### The difference between the government and commercial classification system

### Peer groups
Peer groups are a group of companies engaged in similar business activities which are influenced by closely related factors. Analyst will always use companies within the peer group for **valuation comparisons**.

How to form a **peer group**:
1. Use **commercial classification providers** - to determine which firms are in the same industry
2. **Review the researched company's annual report** to identify key competitors
3. **Examine competitors' annual reports** to identify other key competitors
4. **Study trade publications** to identify more competitors
5. Confirm that the identified firms have:
	- **similar sources of sales and earnings**
	- **similar sources of demand are in similar geographical markets**

## Industry analysis
### Overview 
The **Porter's 5 forces** can provide an analysis framework to understand the threats and competitiveness of a company since, within the same industry:
- the companies are in rivalry against each other
- the bargaining power of the customers 
- the suppliers have bargaining powers which can affect the industry
- a new entrant/joiner can be a threat within the industry
- substitute can also be a threat to the whole industry
The most important to analyse are the existing competitors and new entrant as a threat.

![[Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 19.46.48.png]]

### Porter's 5 forces
Strategic analysis is an analysis of competitive environment of the industry and within the industry, will then implicate the corporate strategy. The **Porter's 5 forces** are the fundamental tool for strategic analysis.
The **Porter's 5 forces** can provide an analysis framework to understand the threats and competitiveness of a company within the same industry:
- the companies are in rivalry against each other
- the bargaining power of the customers 
- the suppliers bargaining powers 
- a new entrant/joiner can be a threat within the industry
- substitute can also be a threat to the whole industry

**Rivalry among existing competitors** - If the industry only have few dominant players ‚áí less competitive; If the industry have many firms of relatively equal size ‚áí more competitive 
- If the market has a slow growth ‚áí the firms fight for market share
- If the fix costs are high ‚áí forces the firms to operate at full capacity and the prices are ‚Üì (e.g. automobile)
- offer undifferentiated products, firms can only compete on price, it'll affect the sustainability and profitability of the firm (e.g. bubble tea shop)

**Power of buyers**
- Few buyers, large orders ‚áí strong bargaining powers - e.g. aircraft parts industry (few buyers, aircraft manufacturers, so the buyers will have the negotiation powers)

**Power of suppliers**
- Few suppliers, material scarce ‚áí suppliers have power to limit supplies to raise prices
- Employees can be viewed as a supplier of labour, a heavily unionised workforce can bring bargaining power as well

**Threat of entry**
- high capital requirement, regulatory approvals ‚áí less competition (e.g. telco industry, build infrastructure and licensing)
- easy to enter ‚áí more competition

**Threat of substitute**
- have limited pricing power if there are lots of substitutes (e.g. Coach industry, if the travellers have affordable substitutes to consider)

There are **6 internal factors** to focus on within the industry rivalry:
- **Barriers to entry**
- **Industry life cycle**
- **Industry concentration**
- **Industry capacity**
- **Market share stability**
- **Price competition**

There are also **5 external factors**, which will be covered later:
- **Macroeconomic influences**
- **Technological influences**
- **Demographic influences**
- **Social influences**
- **Governmental influences**

### Barriers to entry
The **high barriers** of entry can provide the whole industry:
- more benign competitive environment
- greater pricing power
- fewer entrants would want to enter into the industry

Successful player:
e.g. Global credit card networks - Mastercard and VISA - their operating margins are often > 30%. However, there is a high capital requirement and need scale for consumers and merchants to accept to enter into this industry. High hurdles mean fewer entrants would want to enter to the industry and preserving the profitability of current players in the industry.

Unsuccessful player:
eg 2. Airplane manufacturing - Boeing and Airbus - since it requires high capital and high expertise needed to build planes. However, their margins are not that high, since it is a competitive industry, and very little pricing power. It can be attributed by several factors, since **their buyers (airline companies) suffer from strong competition, so cost is a major factor.** It leads to Boeing and Airbus compete on prices to return on invested capital.
eg. 3 Oil refining - high capital requirements and regulatory approval required - again very competitive industry and little pricing power because **refined oil is a commodity** (little differentiation in the product)
Significant capital investment leads the companies in these industry to continue full production even if the demand is low, which will lead to oversupply and ‚Üì price.

**Firms may not have pricing power, despite being in a high barrier of entry industry:**
- if the buyers are very price-sensitive
- product is a commodity
- high barriers to exit

On the other hand, if the low **barriers of entry**, there will be new competitors and entrants to participate in that industry:
- little pricing power
- easy of entry $\ne$ easy to success

e.g. restaurant industry - small amount of capital required

#### How to analyse the ease of entry
Analysing the ease of entry requires:
- How easy is it to obtain :
	- Capital
	- Intellectual property
	- Customer base
- Examine the composition of industry over time

#### Barriers to entry changes over time
- Barriers to entry can change over time due to changes in regulation and changes in technology

e.g. semiconductor industry used to require hefty capital and expertise to build a "fab", due to the change in technology, it is now easier for new entrant to enter the market. The new technology allow the manufacturer to outsource without building their own plant.

### Industry life cycle
![[Screenshot 2023-01-13 at 20.15.57.png]]
There are various stages of a **industry's life cycle**:
- Embryonic
- Growth
- Shakeout
- Mature
- Decline

There are 3 factors to determine the industry's life cycle:
- Growth rate
- Prices
- Competition

#### Embryonic
- **Growth rate** - slow, customers are unfamiliar with product
- **Prices** - high, little economies to scale
- **Competition** - only few competitors
- Large investment required - to develop/market product
- High risk of failure - most startups fail

#### Growth
- **Growth rate** - rapid, new consumers discover the product
- **Prices** - falling, economies of scale are achieved, the distribution channels develop
- **Competition** - limited, as many new entrants but rapid growth enlarges pie for all
- Increasing profitability, due to economies of scale

#### Shakeout
- **Growth rate** - slowing, demands reaching saturation, fewer new customers to be found
- **Prices** - falling, due to overcapacity, profitability starts to decline
- **Competition** - intense, firm growth has to come at expense of competitors
- Focus on survivability - reducing cost structure, increasing brand loyalty
- Increased failures - weaker firms exit or are acquired

#### Mature
- **Growth rate** - slowing/no, demand saturated, demand mainly for replacements
- **Prices** - stable, firms just project market shares, avoid price wars
- **Competition** - consolidating, evolving to oligopoly (a few large sellers)
- High barriers to entry, surviving firms have brand loyalty and low cost structures
- Superior firms gain market share, better products attracts switchers

#### Decline
- **Growth rate** - negative, substitutes emerges, globalisation
- **Prices** - falling, price wars due to overcapacity
- **Competition** - fight to survive in the shrinking market, further consolidation possible

### Industry concentration
**Industry concentration** describes the distribution of market share amongst existing competitors. The industry concentration is concentrated when there're few majority companies within the whole industry (dominant market share). 

**Concentrated** market (few majority companies within the whole industry):
- more benign competitive environment
- greater pricing power

e.g. Global soft drinks industry - Pepsi and Coca-Cola, the consumers are unlikely to change from one to another

**Concentrated industries may be price competitive if**:
- relative market share is similar (Boeing and Airbus have comparable market share, neither enjoys a scale advantage relative to the other)
- products are undifferentiated (automobiles industry - mass market cars produced have little difference in terms of features and performance, requires significant capital to build and high overheads, therefore it is costly to exit; full production ‚Üí oversupply ‚Üí price competition)
- *‚ÄúConcentrated industries have low levels of competition and the companies have greater pricing power‚Äù* - True to a certain extent, but not always the case. Concentrated industries can be very competitive if the relative market share of the companies are similar, products are undifferentiated, or if the industry is too costly to exit.

**Fragmented** industry (many firms of relatively equal size compete):
- highly competitive environment
- limited pricing power

e.g. Airline industry - no particular airline with major market share, limited pricing power on most routes

### Industry capacity
**Industry capacity** is the **supply** of the product or service offered by an industry,
If the **supply** > **demand**, it is known as **over-capacity**, it will put downward pressure on the price ‚áí lower return on capital
If the **demand** > **supply**, it is known as **under-capacity**, it will put upward pressure on the price ‚áí lower return on capital

Analyst should look into:
- Current capacity - capacity is fixed in the **short run** but variable in the **long run**
- Planned additional capacity

![[Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 21.58.12.png]]

![[Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 22.01.47.png | 600]]

### Market share stability 
- **Variable market shares** indicate more competition and lower pricing power
- **Stable market shares** indicate less competition and higher pricing power

Factors that affect market share stability:
- Barriers to entry
- New products/innovations
- Switching cost (include lock-in contracts, time and effort to learn, replacement cost eg. Apple)

## External influences on industry growth, profitability and risk
There are external influences that could impact on the industry's growth, profitability and risk:
- Macroeconomic influences
- Social influences
- Demographic influences
- Technological influences
- Governmental influences

### Macroeconomic influences
Economic trends tends to have significant effects on demand for products and services
To study that, analyst can look into the GDP, which is the measure of value of goods and services produced by an economy

Economic trends can be cyclical (driven by business cycle) and structural (longer-term trends).

Business cycle is primarily affected by 3 factors:
- Interest rate (affects cost of financing)
- Credit availability (affect business and consumer spendings)
- Inflation (affects cost, price, interest rate, business/ consumer confidence)

Structural (longer-term trends) are affected by changes in fundamentals of an economy:
- Education level
- Productivity and real wages
- Demand for consumer goods

### Technological influences
Technological influences can change an industry dramatically through the introduction of new or improved products, some of the examples are:
- Netflix (video streaming) ‚áí replace video rentals
- Spotify (music streaming) ‚áí replace music retail
- Digital photography ‚áí replace camera film
- Uber (ride hailing) ‚áí replacing taxi industry

### Demographic influences
Key factors that influences the population: population size, gender distribution, age distribution (ageing population, with declining workforce).
The needs and wants for each generation might be different:
- **Adolescence/Early adulthood** - clothing, fashion accessories, entertainment products
- **Middle age** - housing, furniture, automobile
- **Retirement age** - healthcare, retirement products

### Governmental influences
There a few key concerns of how government can affect individuals and business:
- Taxes
- Regulations
- Contracts

#### Taxes
- **Income tax** - High income tax ‚áí difficult for industries with low profit margins to survive
- **Consumption tax** - lower demand for certain discretionary goods/services
- **Differential tax** - rates for tobacco, alcohol products

#### Regulations
- Can cause higher barrier of entry
- Can appoint some self-regulatory organisations (e.g. stock exchange)

#### Contracts
- Major consumer of goods and services - reliance on government contract
	- eg. building/construction industry - construction contracts
	- eg. defence industry - government defence contract

### Societal influences
How the society shapes individuals on entertainment (play, social, work, spend money) and other aspects.
e.g. women entering workforce - childcare industry, women's clothing industry, restaurant industry

## Case study on global airline industry
- **Macroeconomic influence** - sensitive to the business cycle as there're a lot of business travellers, if the economy is not doing well, cut down on spending budgets
- **Technological advancement** - Jumbo jet enabled Middle Eastern airlines to thrive on global hub strategy, video conferencing a threat to business travel
- **Demographic influences** - generated growth in air travel demand, the post-WWII baby boomers, revenge traveling of consumers after covid-19 lockdown
- **Governmental influences** - routes, capacity, airlines are negotiated between governments, reduced competition for some routes
- **Societal influences** - rise of middle class in Asia, fuelled rise of low cost carriers in Asia

## Case Study on branded pharmaceutical industry

There are few major pharmaceutical companies - Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Merck.

|**Internal factors**|**Detailed explanation**|
|----|----|
|**Barriers to Entry** üõë |**Very high.** Substantial financial and intellectual capital needed. e.g. R&D, manufacturing plant, global reach|
|**Industry life cycle** üå±|**Mature.** Industry growing steadily for the past 10 years. Trend towards consolidation.|
|**Industrial concentration** ü§πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è|**Concentrated.** 4 companies control >1/5 of global market share, through M&A to increase their company share|
|**Industrial capacity** üè≠|**Not important.** Pricing is primarily determined by patent protection and regulatory issues.|
|**Market share stability** üìä| **Stable.** Major companies have dominated the market share over the past decade.|
|**Price competition** üè∑|**Low.** Consumers are not price sensitive, no suitable alternatives due to patent protection. Bills are normally paid by insurance companies|

|**External factors**|**Detailed explanation**|
|----|----|
|**Macroeconomic influences** üìà |**Defensive.** Economic cycle has little effect on demand. |
|**Technological influences** üéÆ|**Opportunities and threats.** New drugs bring additional revenue, but technology can also bring substitutes.|
|**Demographic influences** üë¥üèª|**Positive.** Likely to benefit from ageing populations in developed countries.|
|**Governmental influences** üá∫üá∏|**Very high.** Sales of drugs are highly regulated, and patent protection may not apply in some countries.|
|**Social influences** üí∏| **Not affected.** Wide range of drugs cater to a wide range of users.|

### Summary of analysing branded pharmaceuticals
- Level of competition is **mild**
- **Mature** industry with steady growth, consolidating towards oligopoly
- High entry barriers point to **stable market share** distribution
- Companies have **pricing power** through patent protection
- Demand is stable and **resilient** against economic cycles
- Industry as a whole is likely to benefit from **ageing populations**

## Company analysis
After analysing the industry from an internal and external view, then an analyst has to go through analysing individual companies:
- Financial position (Financial statement analysis)
- Products/services the company offers
- **Competitive strategy**
- **Elements of analysis**
- **ROE**
- **Spreadsheet modelling**

### Competitive strategy
**Competitive strategy** is how a firm responds to opportunities and threats. An analyst should identify whether the firm's competitive strategy is offensive or defensive.
Michael Porter identified that there are 2 important competitive strategies:
- **Low cost** - cost leadership
- **Differentiation** in product/services
The firm can only choose one of this strategy

#### Cost leadership (low cost)
It includes:
- lowest cost of production
- offer the lowest prices
- generate sufficient volume 
It can be applied **defensively** (protect market share and main profits) or **offensively** (gain market share and increase profits).

The company decides to take on **offensive** or **defensive** approach mostly based on the **intensity level of competition.** For intense industry, the company might take on **predatory pricing**, where in the short-term the price is below the cost to drive out competitors, or to achieve a dominant market share. in the long-term, the company can increase pricing power - to increase the prices and generate higher returns. Although by law, predatory pricing is illegal, however, it is often difficult to prove whether the company is practicing predatory pricing.

What the company have to do when adopting low-cost strategy:
- Tight cost controls
- Efficient operating and reporting systems
- Managerial incentives that reward improving firm efficiency

#### Differentiation - Product/services
When the company offer a product or service that is distinctive with its competitors, either in quality, type or delivery method. The company would offer price its product or services at **premium** - obviously higher than cost of differentiation for continued growth of the company. 

The company should have strong **market research team** to identify the **customer needs** and match it with **product development** and **marketing**.

### Elements of analysis
There are some elements should be covered in a company analysis:
- **Firm overview** - operation, governance, strengths and weaknesses
- **Industry characteristics**
- **Product/services demand**
- **Supply of products/ services**
- **Pricing environment**
- **Financial ratios - include comparisons**

#### 1. Firm overview 
Some of the factor that one might consider when investigating into the firm's overview:
- identity of company's major products and services, current position in industry and history
- Composition of sales
- Product life-cycle stages/**industry experience curve** effects (The experience curve, which shows the cost per unit relative to output, slopes downward because of increases in productivity and economies of scale, especially in industries with high fixed costs.)
- R&D activities
- Past and planned capital expenditures (CapEx)
- Board structure, composition, electoral system, anti-takeover provisions, anond other corporate governance issues
- Management strengths, weaknesses, compensation, turnover, and corporate culture
- Benefits, retirement plans, and their influence on shareholder value
- Labour relationships
- Insider ownership levels and changes 
- Legal actions and the company's state of preparedness
- Other special strengths or weaknesses

#### 2. Industry characteristics
Although it is covered extensively in the previous section, the analyst must remember these key features when conducting a company analysis:
- Stages in its life cycle
- Business-cycle sensitivity or economic characteristics
- Typical product life cycles in the industry
- Brand loyalty, customer switching costs, and intensity of competition
- Entry and exit barriers
- Industry supplier considerations
- Number of companies in the industry and whether it is, as determined by market shares - fragmented or concentrated
- Opportunity to differentiate product/services and relative product/service price, cost, and quality advantages/disadvantages
- Technology used
- Government regulation
- State and history of labour relations
- Other industry problems/opportunity

#### 3. Product/services demand
- Source of demand
- Product of differentiation
- Past record, sensitivities, correlation with social, demographic, economics and other variables
- Outlook - Short, medium and long-term, including new product and business opportunities

#### 4. Supply of products/services (include analysis of costs)
- Sources (concentration, competition and substitutes)
- Industry capacity outlook - Short, medium and long term
- Company's capacity and cost structure
- Import/export considerations
- Proprietary products or trademarks

#### 5. Pricing environment

#### 6. Financial ratios - include comparisons
- **Activity ratios** - Days of sales outstanding (DSO), days of inventory on hand (DIO), days of payables outstanding (DPO)
- **Liquidity ratios** - Current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, cash conversion cycle (CCC)
- **Solvency ratios** - Net debt to capital, debt to asset, debt to capital, financial leverage ratio, cash flow to debt, interest coverage ratio
- **Profitability ratios** - gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax profit margin, net profit margin, return on invested capital (ROIC), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE)
- **Financial statistics and related considerations** - Growth rate of net sales, growth rate of gross profit, EBITDA, net income, operating cash flow, EPS, expected rate of return on retained cash flow, debt maturities and ability of company to refinance and/or repay debt, dividend payout ratio, off-balance-sheet liabilities and contingent liabilitites, non-arm's-length financial dealings

### ROE
**Return on equity (ROE)** is of particular interest, because it can give the analyst an understanding of what's the return and profitability of that company

**Return on equity (ROE)** is the earning financed by the company's total equity, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
where **equity** includes minority equity, preferred equity and common equity and the information can be extracted from balance sheet.

- DuPont analysis to understand the company's account for **return on equity (ROE)** (i.e. turnover of shareholder's return) by seeing the impact of **return on asset(ROA), leverage, tax burden, interest burden, and EBIT margin** by using the original 3-part approach and the extended 5-part approach.
- The original **ROE** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
- The **ROE** can be broken down to a function of a company's **ROA** and its use of **financial leverage**
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,assets} \times \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg.total\,equity}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROE = ROA \times Financial\,leverage}$$
where these are two ratios: **ROA** and **financial leverage** are combined together. The financial leverage is Equity multiplier; it attempts to understand the ownership weight of a company by analyzing how assets have been financed. A company can improve its ROE through either improving **ROA** or **financial leverage**

If a company does not have liabilities, the **financial leverage** will equal to 1.
Therefore, the **ROE** will equal to **ROA** (i.e. $ROE = ROA$).

If a company have liabilities, the **financial leverage** will be greater than 1.
If the borrowing cost < marginal rate of investing ‚áí ‚Üë ROE
If the borrowing cost > marginal rate of investing ‚áí ‚Üì ROE

- **ROA** can be decomposed with **net profit margin** and **total asset turnover**
$$\mathrm{ROA = \frac{Net\,income}{Revenue} \times \frac{Revenue}{Avg.\,Total\,asset}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROA=Net\,profit\,margin \times\,Total\,asset\,turnover}$$
where **net profit margin** determines the **profitability** of a company (i.e. how much income per $ sales?) and **total asset turnover** measures the **efficiency** (i.e. How much revenue per $ of asset?)
- Therefore, the **ROE** determined by the **financial leverage**, **total asset turnover**, **net profit margin**


- **Net profit margin** can be further decomposed to **tax burden**, **interest burden**, and **EBIT margin**
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = \frac{Net\,income}{EBT} \times \frac{EBT}{EBIT} \times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}}$$
$$\mathrm{Net\,profit\,margin = Tax\,burden \times Interest\,burden \times EBIT\,margin}$$

- **Tax burden** is the 1- avg. tax rate 
	- e.g. 30% average tax rate ‚áí tax burden 0.7.
	- ‚Üë tax burden ‚áí keep a higher % of pretax profits

- **Interest burden** captures the effect of interest
	- Higher borrowing cost ‚áí lower interest burden

- **EBIT margin** measures the operating profitability, the value infers the performance of sales and COGS
	- Firms with a higher profitability ‚áí higher EBIT margin

Therefore, the full equation of **DuPont Analysis** is,
$$\mathrm{ROE = \frac{Net\,income}{Avg.total\,assets} \times \frac{Avg. total\,assets}{Avg.total\,equity}\times\frac{Net\,income}{EBT} \times \frac{EBT}{EBIT} \times \frac{EBIT}{Revenue}}$$
$$\mathrm{ROE = ROA \times Financial\,leverage \times Tax\,burden \times Interest\,burden \times EBIT\,margin}$$
**Note:** Average total should use the beginning of the balance sheet and ending of balance sheet, where as the rest can use the period of the income statement

**Note:** A company recently reduced its debt by redeeming some of its outstanding bonds.  All else equal, what is the most likely effect on the firm‚Äôs ROE? A reduction in debt using cash reduces total assets; ROE = Net income/Average total Asset ¬† x ¬† Average total Asset/ Average Total Equity; Avg total asset decreases by same amount in both numerator and denominator. **ROE will remain constant.**

The DuPont 5-way decomposition allow us to analyse the sources of returns for a company and determines the factors that affect the profitability of the company.

### Spreadsheet modelling
Analyst input some of the past financial breakdown of a company and assumptions (future growth rate, margins) to build out a spreadsheet model. The spreadsheet allow the calculation of past ratios and metrics, and from the past data, forecast the future financial statements.

As an analyst, need to understand which factors are likely going to be different going forward and how this will affect the firm.

#### Limitation of spreadsheet modelling
- Errors in input data
- Errors in the model
- Tiny inaccuracies in assumed rates ‚áí large errors after compounding
- Forecasts appear to be precise ‚áí which gives a false sense of security

A cyclical industry is one that is expected to outperform during an expansion and underperform in a contraction. The industry rotation strategy for a cyclical industry is to overweight during an expansion and underweight during a contraction. This does not imply that a manager will rotate entirely out of a cyclical industry.
