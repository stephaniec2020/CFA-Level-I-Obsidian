## Overview of the business cycle
### Phases of business cycle
There are 4 phases of the business cycle:
- **Recovery** - real GDP begins to â†‘
- **Expansion** - real GDP â†‘
- **Peak** - real GDP begins to â†“
- **Contraction** - real GDP â†“
It can be thought of a fluctuation between trend growth of the economy.

There are several factors of concern in regards to the real GDP business cycle:
- **Unemployment** 
- **Spending**
- **Inflation**

![[Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 17.33.18.png]]

Business cycle recur but not at regular intervals, it could be a year to 10 years. Normal assumption and consensus is **2 consecutive quarters of GDP growth** is **beginning of expansion** and **2 consecutive quarters of decline in GDP** marks the **beginning of recession**.

> An economic trough is most closely associated with:
> Accelerating unemployment rates â€“ incorrect as businesses are still cautious about hiring
> Declining capital spending â€“ incorrect as spending slowly pick up during this period
> **Moderate or declining inflation rates** â€“ as price levels are lagging, inflation rates may continue to fall during this period

### Resource use
In terms of resource use fluctuation throughout the business cycle, there are three components to consider:
- **Inventory**
- **Labor**
- **Physical capital**

#### Inventory
As of inventory, firms try to keep a balance, inventory enough to meet demand and not too much capital tied up. As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio fluctuate throughout the business cycle. Since that is the case, monitoring the inventory-to-sales ratio can give certain indication of where we're currently at in the business cycle. Where in **expansion phase**, it is a **planned â†‘ in inventory** â‡’ **expecting and anticipating higher sales**. Whereas near the **peak**, it is **unplanned â†‘ inventory due to â†‘ in production yet â†“ in sales** â‡’ **an early sign of recession forming**.

#### Labour
In terms of **labour**, firms are **typically more reluctant to make changes from hiring and firing** since it is not just costly, but it also affect employee loyalty and morale. The size of the workforce changes should be the last resort. In the recovery stage, the â†‘ in demand is met by â†‘ overtime. In the expansion phase, â†‘â†‘ demand is met through â†‘ overtime and â†‘ workforce through hiring. At the peak, since there is a â†“ in demand, then â†“ overtime. In the contraction phase, â†“â†“ demand leads to â†“ overtime and â†“ workforce through firing.

#### Physical capital
In terms of physical capital, likewise it is costly to buy and sell plant/equipment frequently.
The physical capital stock â†‘ through recovery to expansion and â†“ in peak to contraction. The utilisation and investment are adjusted throughout the cycle to meet the demand.

### Housing sector
Although the **housing sector** is a small part of the economy relative to overall consumer spending, cyclical swings in activity in the housing market can be large so that the effect on overall economic activity is greater than it otherwise would be. 

There are several factors that would affect the housing sector activity:
- **Interest rate** - affect by the business cycle
- **Affordability** - affect by business cycle
- **Speculative activity**
- **Demography**
- **Urbanisation**

#### Interest rate
Many home buyers financed their purchase with a mortgage, **the sector is especially sensitive to interest rates**, which are usually **low during recessions and high during expansion**.

In low interest rate period:
- â†‘ home buying 
- â†‘ construction

In high interest rates period:
- â†“ home buying
- â†“ construction

#### Affordability
Affordability, which is measured by household income/housing prices. If there is an â†‘ in affordability, there would be an â†‘ in sales. However, if the housing prices are already too  high, the affordability is still low even when income â†‘.

#### Speculative activity
Next, we look at speculative activity, which can be independent from the business cycle. People just buy based on the expectation that they can sell real estate on a higher price in a short period, higher prices lead to more construction, eventually resulting in oversupply and a subsequent fall in prices.

The problem with speculative buying is that those who bought at a high price often run into **margin calls** when prices fall as it is bought with financial leverage with taking debt. The forced sales of many of these units lead not just to further falls in housing prices, but also destabilises the financial system, as evidenced in the 2008 financial crisis.

#### Demography
The proportion of the population in the **25 to 40 year old** segment is particularly important because these are the ages where **demand for new housing is the greatest**.

#### Urbanisation
Urbanisation also plays an important role in housing activity when governments encourage shifts from rural areas to cities, construction activity in cities picks up to accommodate new settlers.

### External trade
**External trade** activity varies according to the business cycle. Here we have to distinguish between the domestic GDP growth and the trading partners, GDP growth. Increasing growth of domestic GDP leads to increases in imports of foreign goods, while decreasing domestic GDP growth reduces imports.

Exports depend on the growth rates of GDP, of the trading partners, increasing foreign incomes, increase exports and decreasing economic growth in foreign countries, decreases exports.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 02.49.52.png|600]]

One complicating factor is the relative strength of the country's currency. If a country's currency strengthens against its trading partners, its goods are relatively more expensive, so exports decrease. Conversely, foreign goods are now cheaper, so imports increase.

If foreign currency strengthens, the country's goods become relatively cheaper than foreign goods, exports increase and imports decrease.

## Theories of the business cycle
**Business cycles** are a result of fluctuations in **aggregate demand (AD)** and **short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)** which are determined by market forces and the government. 

### Market forces and business cycle
The **consumer/business sentiment** affect the **AD**, whereas the **input prices and wages** affect the **SRAS**. **External shocks** and **technology** can affect both **AD and SRAS**. 

### Government and business cycle
The government can also affect the AD and SRAS. Through **monetary policy**, the government affect the **interest rate** and control the **money supply** thus affecting the **AD**. Through **fiscal policy**, the government can increase/reduce **government spending** and directly affecting **AD**, and **tax rates** can affect the **AD and SRAS**.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 02.56.17.png| 600]]

### Theory of business cycles
There are several theories of business cycles:
- **Neoclassical** - views business cycles as fluctuations in AD and AS, technology advance, tendency towards full-employment equilibrium, **no intervention is needed**
- **Austrian** - attributes business cycles to the effects of AD and AS, but misguided government actions causes business cycles, **government should avoid intervention**.
- **Keynesian** - changes in consumer/business sentiment (AD) and the role of fiscal policy is required 
- **Monetarist** - emphasises the influence of money supply and monetary policy on business cycles
- **New classical school** - highlights the role of technology and external shows in explaining business cycles, **government should avoid intervention**.

### Neoclassical school theory of business cycles
**Neoclassical economists** believe that the economy has a **strong tendency toward full employment equilibrium**. So in theory, business cycles should not exist. However, they do acknowledge that changes in **technology can greatly affect certain industries** that are displaced by the technology, and that can cause limited **short term lowering of aggregate demand resulting in a recession**.

Nevertheless, neoclassical economists believe that such **recessions are short lived as unemployment will lower wages**, **shifting the SARS curve to the right** such that the economy is back to its long run equilibrium. **No intervention is needed from the government.**

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 02.59.14.png]]

### Austrian school theory of business cycles
Economists of the Austrian school share most of the beliefs of the neoclassical school. The key difference is that the Austrian economists argue that **business cycles** are not a result of changes in technology, but **misguided interventions by the government**.

When **policymakers force interest rates down to artificially low levels, firms invest too much in speculative lines of production**. When these **investments turn out poorly, firms must decrease output in those lines, which causes a contraction**.

As such, Austrian economists believe that government intervention is not just unnecessary, but that it should be avoided altogether. So, in essence, neoclassical and Austrian theories both agree that wages will adjust such that the economy will always return to full employment.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.01.20.png]]

### Keynesian school theory and business cycles
The Keynesian economists, while agreeing that neoclassical theory has its merit, **argue that it can take a very long time for the market to adjust wages and go back to full employment**.

This is because **wages are inherently downward sticky**, that is, **many will choose to remain unemployed rather than to accept a pay cut**.

The Keynesian also believed that the business cycle is the **result of swings in market sentiment** rather than changes in technology or government intervention. In fact, they **argue that the long and deep recessions, government intervention, particularly in the form of expansionary fiscal policy, is necessary to save the economy**.
![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.03.30.png]]

### Monetarist school theory and business cycle
The monetarists school, however, object to the commission recommendation for government intervention for a number of reasons.

Monetarists believe that the Keynesian focus on fiscal policy is misplaced. The Keynesian model fails to consider the **long term harm that can be caused by sustained government budget deficits**.

Besides, there **may be a lag in the stimulative effects of fiscal policy** and may be too slow to prevent an economic crisis from blowing up. Rather than fiscal policy, **monetarists believe money supply has the greatest effect on the economy** when the money supply grows too fast, the boom is unsustainable. When it grows too slow, the economy contracts as such. One of the **main culprits of business cycles is the variations in money supply caused by monetary policy**.

**Monetarists recommend that the government should follow a policy of steady and predictable increases in the money supply in order to keep aggregate demand stable and growing**.
![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.05.46.png]]

### New classical school theory and business cycle 
The new classical school economists also argue against government intervention as the predictable loosening and tightening of money supply itself can cause a recession, as businesses would just wait for easy money to start investing.

As such, new classical models do not include money, but that **business cycles are caused by real factors such as changes in technology and external shocks**.

Such models are called real business cycle models, new classical economists believe that expansions and contractions represent efficient operation of the economy in response to external real shocks and technological changes. This, again, is **justification that the government should not intervene in the economy**.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.07.25.png]]

## Credit cycle
Business cycles uses real GDP as a measure of economic activity. **Credit cycles**, on the other hand, refer to **cyclical fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans** where the bottom of the cycle is characterised by high interest rates and low availability of loans.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.09.52.png]]

### Relation between business and credit cycle
Apparently, the business and credit cycles are intertwined. Typically, lenders are more willing to lend and tend to offer lower interest rates during economic expansions and are less willing to lend and require higher interest rates when the economy is contracting. 

The effect goes the other way as well. When credit is cheap and widely available, asset **bubbles** can form, particularly in the **equity and property market**. When **credit subsequently tightens and gets more expensive**, **asset prices plunge** and lead to a **domino effect of defaults**.

Research suggests that when the directions of the business cycle coincide with the directions of the credit cycles, economic expansions tend to be stronger and contractions are deeper and longer.

**However, do be aware that the directions of the two cycles may not always coincide.** Research suggests that credit cycles tend to be longer in duration than business cycles.

There were two business cycles in the US economy in the Dot-com bubble and the great financial crisis of 2008, however there were only 1 credit cycle. Within the same period when the expansion in credit coincided with economic expansion after the dot com bubble, the economic expansion was strong.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.12.53.png]]

### Stage of credit cycle and investment decisions
Some investors may study the **stage of the credit cycle** to **guide investment decisions**.
Research into credit cycle can answer some questions:
- Property price increase caused by excessive credit?
- Is a recession likely?
Firstly, it helps to explain if a boom in real estate prices is a consequence of excessive credit. Secondly, it helps investors assess the likelihood of a recession in many past recessions, long periods of excessive credit that coincide with economic boom tend to result in a recession that was preceded by a tightening of credit.

## Unemployment
**Unemployment** is defined as .**Unemployed person** is defined by not working but actively seeking for work, and **long-term unemployed person** is someone who is searching for job for a long time (typically > 3 months). **Underemployed** is someone who is employed part-time but would prefer to work full-time or is paid far below qualification/skills. **Discouraged worker** is one who has given up looking for a job, perhaps because of a weak economy, and has temporarily stopped seeking employment. **Voluntarily unemployed** are people who choose not to be employed are said to be voluntarily unemployed either because wages are not up to their expectation or they choose to retire early.

There are several types of unemployment:
- **Frictional unemployment**
- **Cyclical unemployment**
- **Structural unemployment**

#### Frictional unemployment
**Frictional unemployment** is due to the time lag necessary to match job seekers with employers. In any economy, employers hire to meet increased demand and fire when demand falls. Workers also quit to look for better jobs. A new graduates start looking for jobs. This is unavoidable, and with any economy, there will always be some frictional unemployment.

#### Cyclical unemployment
Cyclical unemployment is caused by **short-run** changes in the general level of economic activity. In a recession, the number of available jobs is fewer, so the proportion of unemployed increases.

#### Structural unemployment
Structural unemployment, on the other hand, is caused by **long-run** changes in the economy that eliminate some jobs. While new jobs for which the unemployed workers are not qualified arise, this is a structural problem because the unemployed workers do not currently have the skills needed to perform the jobs that are available.

### Metrics for measuring unemployment
**Participation ratio** measures the size of the labour force (including the employed, underemployed, unemployed, long-term unemployed) over working-age population (which includes the discouraged workers and voluntarily unemployed). 

The **participation ratio** equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Participation\,ratio = \frac{Size\,of\,labour\,force}{Working\,age\,population}}$$

The **unemployment rate** is the unemployed over the size of labour force. Unemployment rate might not be a fair representation of unemployment situation. When researching on **unemployment rate**, analyst must also look at **participation ratio**, as **it could have been more discouraged workers who are not in the labour force**.

The unemployment rate equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Unemployment\,rate = \frac{Unemployed}{Size\,of\,labour\,force}}$$
Discouraged workers are statistically outside the labor force, which means they're not counted in the official unemployment rate.
Unemployment rate is a lagging indicator as employers try to minimize hiring and firing (i.e. unemployment rate lags actual economic output).

#### Other labour related indicators for business cycle fluctuation
Since unemployment rate might not be the best indicator of business cycle as it lags, there are several leading indicators:
- **Payroll growth**
- **Number of hours worked**
- **Temporary workers**
- **Productivity**

**Payroll growth** - To get a better picture of the employment cycle, many analysts prefer to study **payroll growth**. Although payroll data may be biased, there is a clear indication of economic trouble when payrolls shrink and a clear indication of recovery when they rise.

**Number of hours worked**, especially overtime, and the **use of temporary workers** may also be useful indications of economic activity. Firms tend to **â†‘ overtime** hours and hire **part time workers** to cope with **initial pick up in demand in the early stage of a recovery**. Therefore, these are indicators may be a better signal of economic recovery than the unemployment rate.

**Productivity** measures output against number of workersï¼š
- Early contraction: Productivity â†“ as firms keep workers despite â†“ output
- Early expansion: Productivity â†‘ as firms refrain from hiring despite â†‘ output

## Inflation
**Inflation** is the sustained increase in **overall price level** over time. Almost all goods and services increase in price level. It erodes the purchasing power, i.e. same dollar can buy lesser goods and services over time. Inflation favours the borrower at expense of lender, since there is a lower purchasing power in future.

**Inflation rate** is normally compared against the prior year, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Inflation\,rate=\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}-1}$$
The inflation rate is the percentage increase in the price level typically compared to the prior year.

### Types of inflation 
In general, the inflation rate is pro-cyclical, that is, it goes up and down with the business cycle, but with a lag of a year or more.

There are 4 types of inflation:
- **Inflation** - inflation are generally pro-cyclical with 1 year lag
- **Disinflation** - inflation rate that is decreasing over time but still > 0
- **Deflation** - inflation rate is persistently negative over a period of time
- **Hyperinflation** - inflation rate that accelerates out of control

**Deflation** is the phenomenon where the inflation rate is persistently negative over a period of time. Deflation is commonly associated with deep recessions and is a scenario that central banks want to avoid at all costs as it is difficult to bring an economy out of deflation. This is because when most prices are decreasing, consumers delay purchases because they believe they can buy the same goods more cheaply in the future. This depresses aggregate demand, causing prices to further decline in a downward spiral.

Deflation is often associated with liquidity trap conditions. A liquidity trap is a situation in which demand for money becomes highly elastic. Expanding the money supply has little effect on economic activity under these conditions because individuals and firms choose to hold the additional money in cash.

At the other extreme, **hyperinflation** which can destroy a country's monetary system and bring about social and political upheavals.

To prevent either scenario from happening, **central banks** tend to **closely monitor the inflation rate** and **take monetary actions** to **keep it within a target range**.

Contractionary monetary policies like increasing the benchmark interest rate are used when inflation is too high. Expansionary policies are used when the inflation rate is too low. As such, analysts and investors often monitor inflation rate to anticipate the central bank's monetary policy, which can have a profound effect on asset prices.

**Inflation can be a result of cost pressures or demand pressures.**

### Cost-push inflation
When the **cost of an important factor of production, such as labor or energy increases**, the SRAS curve of the economy is shifted to the left. At the new short run equilibrium, output is â†“, but price is â†‘. If the central bank opts to stimulate AD so output returns to its long run potential, the result would be a further â†‘â†‘ in the price level.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 03.53.41.png]]
![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 01.23.25.png]]

### Ways of studying wage pressures
1. Unemployment rate: â†“ unemployment, â†‘ wage pressures
2. NAIRU/NARU non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment/ natural rate of unemployment (i.e. jobs-skills mismatch, cultural patters, market inefficiencies)
3. Labour productivity - wage increases are not inflationary if in line with productivity
$$\mathrm{Unit\,labour\,cost = \frac{Total\,labour\,compensation/hr}{Output\,units/hr}}$$
4. Expected inflation - with â†‘ inflation expectations, â†‘ wage demands
$$\mathrm{Indicator\,of\,expected\,inflation = \frac{Yield\,on\,inflation\,indexed\,bonds}{Yield\,on\,non-indexed \,bond}}$$

### Demand-pull inflation
When **prices rise as a result of demand pressures**, it's called **demand-pull inflation**. The **increased demand** is usually a result of an **increase in the money supply or increased government spending**.

When this happens, the AD curve shifts to the right. At this new short run equilibrium, both the output and price levels are higher.

With real GDP above its full employment level, the increase in GDP is not sustainable. Unemployment falls below its natural rate, which puts upward pressure on real wages and input prices.

Rising cost of production results in a decrease in SRAS until real GDP reverts back to full employment GDP. Although output falls back to full employment GDP, the price level is now even higher.

However, **if the central bank continues to increase the rate of money supply**, this cycle is set to **continue raising price levels in an upward spiral**.

### Study the capacity utilisation rate of key industries
To measure the potential for demand, pull inflation in an economy, economists often study the capacity utilisation rate of key industries.

â†‘ rates of capacity utilisation â‡’ economy producing above potential GDP â‡’ inflationary pressure

### Differences between 
![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 01.29.37.png]]
The key difference between demand pull and cost push effects is the impact on output.
The demand pull effect increases GDP above full employment GDP, while the cost push effect decreases GDP, resulting in higher short term unemployment.

## Measuring inflation
**Inflation rate** is normally compared against the prior year, and the equation is as follows:
$$\mathrm{Inflation\,rate=\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}-1}$$
The inflation rate is the percentage increase in the price level typically compared to the prior year.

Most countries calculate **consumer price index (CPI)**, with the general idea of the CPI is to determine a basket of goods and services that reflect the cost of living of a typical consumer.

As the typical consumer can differ vastly between countries, each country that wants to calculate the CPI has to determine their own basket of goods and services that best represents the cost of living in the country.

### Laspeyres index
**Laspeyres index** is a CPI index where using the exact composition and the exact quantity as the basis for this price index. 

With the **Laspeyres index** the calculation would be as follows:
$$\mathrm{CPI_{Laspeyres} =\frac{Cost\,of\,Basket\,at\,current\,prices}{Cost\,of\,Basket\,at\,base\,period\,prices} \times100}$$

Short comings of Laspeyres:
1. **Quality bias**
2. **New product bias**
3. **Substitution bias** 

#### Quality bias
When the product price â†‘, it may be partially due to quality â†‘ and not just inflation.
E.g. Car improvement in safety and reliability
**Quality bias** can be adjusted by **hedonic pricing**: current prices adjusted for the improvements in quality

#### New product bias
**New products** are frequently introduced and priced competitively to gain market share.

However, a fixed basket of goods and services will not include them in general, this situation again creates an upward bias in the Laspeyres index.

This bias can be easily fixed by periodically reviewing consumption habits to adjust the quantities of the current basket of goods and add in new products that consumers are switching to.

#### Substitution bias
**Substitution bias** when two goods are substitutes for each other, consumers buy more of the relatively cheaper good and buy less of the relatively more expensive good.

However, if we continue to use outdated consumption figures from the base period, the Laspeyres index can be upwardly biased again.

To fix the substitution bias, a change price index like the **Fisher Index** can be used. A Fisher index is the **geometric mean of Laspeyres index and Paasche index**.

**Fisher index** equation is as follows: 
$$\mathrm{CPI_{Fisher} =(CPI_{Laspeyres} \times CPI_{Paasche})^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$

A **Paasche index** uses the **current consumption weights** and **current prices** to **compute the cost of the basket**. Take the geometric mean of the two indices and we get a **Fisher Index**. This is an adjusted CPI that takes into account that consumers may have substituted a relatively more expensive goods with relatively cheaper substitutes.

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 12.16.33.png]]
> Base year price = 80Ã—1.2 + 50Ã—0.7 = $131  
> Current year price (Laspeyres) = 80Ã—1.8 + 50Ã—1.5 = $219  
> Current year price (Paasche) = 90Ã—1.8 + 30Ã—1.5 = $207
> 
> Base year price with current year qty (Paasche) = 90Ã—1.2 + 30Ã—0.7 = $129  
> CPI (Laspeyres) = 219/131 x100 = 167.2  
> CPI (Paasche) = 207/129 x100 = 160.47

CPI(Fisher) = (Laspeyres x Paasche)^.5 = (167.2Ã—160.47)^.5 = 163.8

### Personal consumption expenditures (PCE)
Besides the CPI, an alternative measure of consumer price inflation is the price index for **personal consumption expenditures (PCE)**. Unlike the CPI, which is usually based on household surveys, **PCE is based on business surveys**.

### Producer price index (PPI)
The **producer price index (PPI), or wholesale price index**, is another important inflation measure that reflects the price changes experienced by producers. This is based on items like energy, farm products, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment and so on. Since the price increases in producer of these items may eventually pass through to customers, the **PPI can be a predictor of the future CPI**.

### Headline inflation vs core inflation
Both consumer and producer prices, analysts and policy makers often distinguish between **headline inflation** and **core inflation**. **Headline inflation** refers to **price indices for all goods**. **Core inflation** refers to **price indices that exclude food and energy**.

As food and energy prices are typically more volatile than other goods, core inflation is therefore less volatile and can sometimes be a more useful measure of the underlying trend in prices.

### GDP deflator
Many countries publish a GDP deflator index that's used to eliminate the price effect in nominal GDP data so as to identify trends in real economic growth. **Price indices can often be used to derive this GDP deflator**.

## Economic indicators
There are several types of indicators:
- **Leading indicators** - tend to change direction before peaks and troughs of business cycle
- **Coincident indicators** - changed direction at roughly the same time as the peaks or troughs
- **Lagging indicators** - don't change direction until expansions or contractions are already underway

**Leading indicators** - help with **anticipating** cyclical turns and allow strategists and businesses to **position** themselves to benefit/protect themselves from movements in the business cycle
**Coincident and lagging indicators** - **confirm** that the economy is in an actual expansion or contraction phase

In the United States, a market research organisation called the **Conference Board** compiles leading coincident and lagging indicators for the U.S. and several major economies, include the following leading indicators, coincident indicators, and lagging indicators.

### Leading indicators
There are several **leading indicators**:
- Average weekly hours in manufacturing
- **Initial claims for unemployment insurance** - sensitive indication of initial layoffs and rehiring
- Manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods
- Manufacturers' new orders for non-defense goods
- **Institute for Supply Management (ISM) new orders index** - decline in new orders can be indication of weakness in demand
- Building permits for new houses
- **S&P 500 equity price index** - stock prices anticipate economic turning point
- Lending credit index
- 10-year treasury to fed funds interest rate spread
- Consumer expectations

Some of the more notable components are the average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance.

### Coincident indicators
There are several **coincident indicators**:
- **Employees on nonfarm payrolls** - businesses adjust their full-time payrolls once recession/recovery is clear 
- Aggregate real personal income
- Index of industrial production
- Manufacturing and trade sales

### Lagging indicator
There are several **lagging indicators**:
- Average duration of unemployment
- **Inventory-sales ratio** - businesses are slow to stock up on inventory
- Change in unit labour costs
- Average prime lending rate
- **Commercial and industrial loans** - these loans frequently support inventory building
- Ratio of consumer instalment debt-to-income
- **Change in consumer price index (CPI)** - inflation generally adjusts to the cycle late as producers are slow to adjust prices

![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 02.31.15.png]]

### Composite of indicators
Besides individual indicators, some organisations publish **aggregate indices** that are a composite of indicators known respectively to lead the cycle, run coincident with it or lag it at cyclical turns.

In the **U.S.**, one well-known composite leading indicator is the **Index of Leading Economic Indicators (LEI)**, which has 10 component parts similar to the ones we've discussed.

The OECD also calculates the **Composite Leading Indicator (CLI)** indices which gauge the state of the business cycle in **several countries**, the **EU and G7 nations**.

### Points to consider when using economic indicators
There are several points to consider when using economic indicator:
- should never make conclusions about the business cycle by observing just one or two individual indicators in isolation
- confirm if your conclusions are supported by the aggregate index or other individual indicators
- classifications as leading, coincident, and lagging indicators reflect tendencies in the timing of their turning points, **not** exact relationships
- not all changes in direction of leading indicator indices have been followed by corresponding changes in the business cycle
- have the leading indicator, time can be varied from different business cycle
